BENE AM BELL PAC CRIM PROB GRAV LEV WordsfromMythologyandHist ory


BENE is Latin for "well." A benefit is a good result or effect . Something beneficial produces good result s or effect s. The Latin root can be heard in other languages as well: "Good!" or "Fine!" in Spanish is "Bueno!"; in French, it 's "Bon!"; and in Italian, just say "Bene!"
 
==========benediction
A prayer thatasks for God's blessing, especially a prayer that concludes a worship service.


?
 The moment the bishop had finished his benedict ion, she squeezed quickly out of her row and dart ed out the cathedral's side entrance.


In benediction, the bene root is joined by another Latin root , dictio, "speaking" (see DICT), so the  word's meaning  becomes something  like  "well-wishing." Perhaps the best -known benedict ion is the so-called Aaronic Benedict ion from the Bible, which begins, "May the Lord bless you and keep you." An important sect ion of the Catholic Mass was tradit ionally known as the Benedictus, aft er it s first word (meaning "blessed"). It was St . Benedict who organized the first Christ ian monast eries; many Christ ians have been bapt ized Benedict in his honor, and 16 popes have taken itas their papal name.
 
==========benefact or
Someone who helps another person or group, especially by giving money.


?
 An anonymous benefact or had given $15 million to establish an ecological inst it ut e at the universit y.


A benefact or may be involved in almostany field. One may endow a scholarship fund; another may give money to expand a library; st ill another may leave a generous sum to a hospital in her will. The famous benefactions of John D. Rockefeller included the gift s that established the Universit y of Chicago, the Rockefeller Foundat ion, and  Rockefeller  Universit y.  Many benefact ors have report ed that giving away their money t urned out to be the mostrewarding thing they ever did.
 
==========beneficiary
           A person or organizat ion that benefit s or is expect ed to benefit from something, especially one thatreceives money or propert y when someone dies.


?
 Living in a trailer in near-povert y, she received word in the mail thather father had died, naming her as the sole beneficiary of his life-insurance policy.


Beneficiary is oft en used in connect ion with life insurance, but it shows up in many other cont ext s as well. A college may be the beneficiary of a privat e donat ion. Your uncle's will may make a church his sole beneficiary, in which case all his money and propert y will go to it when he dies. A "third-part y beneficiary" of a contract is a person (oft en a child) who the people signing the contract (which is usually an insurance policy or an employee-benefit plan) want to benefit from it . In a more general way, a small business may be a beneficiary of changes to the tax code, or a restaurant may be the beneficiary when the one across the street closes down and it s whole lunch crowd start s coming in.
 
==========benevolence Kindness, generosit y.


?
 In those financially desperat e years, the young couple was saved only by the benevolence of her elderly great -uncle.


Part of benevolence comes from the Latin root meaning "wish." The novels of Charles Dickens oft en  include  a benevolent  figure  who  rescues  the  main  charact ers  at  some  point -Mr. Brownlow  in Oliver Twist, Abel Magwit ch in David Copperfield, Mr. Jarndyce in Bleak House, Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. To be benevolent , ithelps to have money, but it 's not necessary; kind assistance of a nonfinancial sort may t urn out to be lifesaving benevolence as well.
 
==========AM comes from the Latin amare, "t o love." The Roman god of love was known by two different names, Cupid and Amor. Amiable means "friendly or good-nat ured," and amigo is Spanish for "friend."
 
==========amicable
  Friendly, peaceful.


?
 Their relat ions with their in-laws were generally amicable, despit e some bickering during the holidays.


Amicable oft en describes relat ions bet ween two groups, or especially two nat ions-for example, the Unit ed Stat es and Canada, which are proud of sharing the longest unguarded border in the world. So we oft en speak of an amicable meet ing or an amicable set t lement . When amicable describes more personal relat ions, it may indicat e a rather formal friendliness. But it 's always nice when two friends who've been quarreling manage to have an amicable conversat ion and to say amicable good-byes at the end.
 
==========enamored                           Charmed or fascinat ed; inflamed with love.


?
 Rebecca quickly became enamored of the t own's rust ic surroundings, it s slow pace, and it s eccentric charact ers.


Comput er hackers are always enamored of their new programs and games. Millions of readers have found themselves enamored with Jane Aust en's novels. And Romeo and Juliet were, of course, ut t erly enamored of each other. But we also oft en use the word in negat ive cont ext s: A friend at work may complain that she's not enamored of the new boss, and when you start talking abouthow you're not enamored with the neighbors it may be t ime to move. (Not e that both of and with are commonly used aft er enamored.)
 
==========amorous                          Having or showing strong feelings of at tract ion or love.


?
 It t urned out that the amorous Congressman had got t en his girlfriend a good job and was paying for her apart ment .


A couple smooching on a park bench could be called amorous, or a young married couple who are always hugging and kissing. But  the word is oft en used a bit  sarcast ically, as when a tabloid newspaper get s hold of some scandalous phot os and calls the part icipant s "the amorous pair." In such cases, we may be encouraged to think the at tract ion is more physical than emot ional.
 
==========paramour
 A lover, oft en secret , notallowed by law or cust om.


?
 He had been coming to the house for two years before her brothers realized thathe was act ually the paramour of their shy and withdrawn sist er.


Paramour came to English from French (a language based on Latin), though the modern French don't use the word. Since par amour meant "through love," it implies a relat ionship based solely on love, oft en physical love, rather than on social cust om or ceremony. So t oday it t ends to refer to the lover of a married man or woman, but may be used for any lover who isn't obeying the social rules.

==========BELL  comes  from  the  Latin  word  meaning  "war." Bellona  was  the  lit t le-known  Roman goddess of war; her husband, Mars, was the god of war.
 
==========ant ebellum                 Exist ing before a war, especially before the American Civil War (1861-65).


?
 When World War I was over, the  French  nobilit y  found  it  impossible to ret urn to their extravagantant ebellum way of life.


Even countries that win a war oft en end up worse off than they had been before, and the losers almostalways do. So antebellum oft en summons up images of ease, elegance, and ent ertainment that disappeared in the post war years. In the American South, the ant ebellum way of life depended on a social struct ure, based on slavery, that collapsed aft er the Civil War; Margaret Mit chell's Gone with the Wind shows the nostalgia and bit t erness felt by wealthy Southerners aft er the war more than the relief and ant icipat ion experienced by those released from slavery. In Europe, World War I shat t ered the grand life of the upper classes, even in vict orious France and Britain, and changed societ y hugely in the space of just four years.
 
==========bellicose                          Warlike, aggressive, quarrelsome.


?
 The more bellicose part y always got elect ed whenever there was t ension along the border and the public believed that military act ion would lead to securit y.


Since bellicose describes an at t it ude thathopes for act ual war, the word is generally applied to nat ions and their leaders. In the 20th cent ury, it was commonly used to describe such figures as Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm, Italy's Benit o Mussolini, and Japan's General Tojo, leaders who believed their countries had everything to gain by start ing wars. The int ernat ional relat ions of a nat ion with a bellicose foreign policy t end to be st ormy and difficult , and bellicosity usually makes the rest of the world very uneasy.
 
==========belligerence
Aggressiveness, combat iveness.


?
 The belligerence in Turner's voice t old them that the warning was a serious threat .


Unlike bellicose and bellicosity, the word belligerence can be used at every level from the personal to the  global. The  belligerence  of  Marlon  Brando's  performances  as  the  violent Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire electrified the country in the 1940s and '50s. At the same t ime, belligerent speeches by leaders of the Soviet  Union and the Unit ed Stat es throughout  the Cold War were keeping the world on edge. Belligerent is even a noun; the t errible war in the Congo in recent years, for example, has involved seven nat ions as belligerent s.
 
==========rebellion
Open defiance and opposit ion, somet imes armed, to a person or thing in authorit y.


?
 A st udentrebellion thataft ernoon in Room 13 result ed in the new subst it ut e t eacher racing out of the building in t ears.


Plent y of t eenagers rebel against their parent s in all kinds of ways. Buta rebellion usually involves a group. Armed rebellions are usually put down by a country's armed forces, or at least kept from expanding beyond a small area. The American War of Independence was  first viewed by the Brit ish as a minor rebellion that would soon run it s course, but this part icular rebellion led to a full-fledged revolut ion-that is, the overthrow of a government . Rebellion, armed or otherwise, has oft en alert ed those in power that those they control are very unhappy.
 
==========PAC is relat ed to the Latin words for "agree" and "peace." The Pacific Ocean-that is, the "Peaceful Ocean"-was named by Ferdinand Magellan because it seemed so calm aft er he had sailed through the st orms near Cape Horn. (Magellan obviously had never wit nessed a Pacific t yphoon.)
 
==========pacify                        (1) To soothe anger or agitat ion. (2) To subdue by armed act ion.


?
 It t ook the police hours to pacify the angry demonstrat ors.


Someone st irred up by a strong emot ion can usually be pacified by some kind words and the removal of it s causes. Unhappy babies are oft en given a rubber pacifier for sucking to make them st op crying. During the Viet nam War, pacification of an area meant using armed force to drive out the enemy, which might be followed by bringing the local people over to our side by building schools and providing social services. Butan army can oft en bring "peace" by pure force, without soothing anyone's emot ions.
 
==========pacifist                           A person opposed to war or violence, especially someone who refuses to bear arms or to fight , on moral or religious grounds.


?
 Her grandfather had fought in the Marines in World War I, but in his lat er years he had become almosta pacifist , opposing every war for one reason or another.


The Quakers and the Jehovah's Wit nesses are pacifistreligious groups, and Henry David Thoreau and Mart in Luther King are probably the most famous American pacifist s. Like these groups and individuals, pacifist s haven'talways met with sympathy or understanding. Refusing to fight ever, for any reason, calls for strong faith in one's own moral or religious convict ions, since pacifism during wart ime has oft en got t en people persecut ed and even thrown in prison.
 
==========pact  An  agreement  bet ween  two or more  people  or groups; a  treaty  or formal agreement bet ween nat ions to deal with a problem or to resolve a disput e.


?
 The girls made a pact never to reveal whathad happened on that t errifying night in the abandoned house.


Pacthas "peace" at it s root because a pact oft en ends a period of unfriendly relat ions. The word is generally used in the field of int ernat ional relat ions, where diplomat s may speak of an "arms pact ," a "trade pact ," or a "fishing-right s pact ." But it may also be used for any solemn agreement or promise bet ween two people; aft er all, whenever two part ies shake hands on a deal, they're notabout to go to war with each other.
 
==========pace                  Contrary to the opinion of.


?
 She had only three husbands, pace some Hollywood hist orians who claim she had as many as six.


This word looks like another that is much more familiar, but not ice how it 's pronounced. It is used only by int ellect uals, and oft en print ed in italics so that the reader doesn't mistake it for the other word. Writ ers use it when correct ing an opinion that many people believe; for example, "The cost s of the program, pace some commentat ors, will not be significant ." So what does pace have to do with peace?
 Because it says "Peace to them (that is, to the people I'm ment ioning)-I don't want to startan argument ; I just want to correct the fact s."

==========CRIM comes from the Latin words for "fault or crime" or "accusat ion." It 's obvious where the root shows up most commonly in English. A crime is an act forbidden by the government , which the government it self will punish you for, and for which you may be branded a criminal. A crime is usually more serious than a tort (see TORT), a "civil wrong" for which the wronged person musthimself sue if he want s to getrepaid in some way.
 
==========criminology                        The  st udy  of  crime,  criminals,  law  enforcement ,  and punishment .


?
 His growing int erest in criminology led him to become a probat ion officer.


Criminology includes the st udy of all aspect s of crime and law enforcement -criminal psychology, the social set t ing of crime, prohibit ion and prevent ion, invest igat ion and det ect ion, capt ure and punishment . Thus, many of the people involved-legislat ors, social workers, probat ion officers, judges, et c.-could possibly be considered criminologists, though the word usually refers only to scholars and researchers.
 
==========decriminalize
      To remove or reduce the criminal stat us of.


?
 An angry debat e over decriminalizing doct or-assist ed suicide raged all day in the stat ehouse.


Decriminalization of various "vict imless crimes"-crimes that don't direct ly harm others, such as privat e gambling and drug-taking-has been recommended by conservat ives as well as liberals, who oft en claim that it would ease the burden on the legal syst em, decrease the amount of money flowing to criminals, and increase personal libert y. Decriminalizat ion is not the same as legalizat ion; decriminalizat ion may st ill call for a small fine (like a traffic t icket ), and may apply only to use or possession of something, leaving the act ual sale of goods or services illegal.
 
==========incriminat e
To show evidence of involvement in a crime or a fault .


?
 The muddy tracks leading to and from the cookie jar were enough to incriminat e them.


Test imony may incriminat e a suspect by placing him at the scene of a crime, and incriminating evidence is the kind that strongly links him to it . But the word doesn'talways refer to an act ual crime. We can say, for instance, thata virus has been incriminat ed as the cause of a t ype of cancer, or that video games have been incriminat ed in the decline in st udy skills among young people.
 
==========recriminat ion
  (1) An accusat ion in answer to an accusat ion made against oneself. (2) The making of such an accusat ion.


?
 Their failure to find help led to endless and point less recriminat ions over responsibilit y for the accident .


Defending oneself from a verbal at tack by means of a count erat tack is as nat ural as physical self-defense. So a disast er oft en brings recriminat ions among those connect ed with it , and divorces and child-cust ody bat t les usually involve recriminat ions bet ween husband and wife. An act ual crime isn't generally involved, but it may be; when two suspect s start exchanging angry recriminat ions aft er they've been picked up, it oft en leads to one of them t urning against  the other in court .
 
==========PROB comes from the Latin words for "prove or proof" and "honest y or int egrit y." A probe, whether it 's a lit t le object for t est ing electrical circuit s or a spacecraftheaded for Mars, is basically something that 's looking for evidence or proof. And probable  originally  described something that wasn't certain but might be "provable."
 
==========approbat ion
 A formal or official act of approving; praise, usually given with pleasure or enthusiasm.


?
 The senat e signaled it s approbat ion of the new plan by vot ing for it unanimously.


Approbation is a noun form of approve, butapprobat ion is usually stronger than mere approval. An official commendat ion for bravery is an example of approbat ion; get t ing reelect ed to office by a wide margin indicat es public approbat ion; and the social approbat ion received by a star quart erback in high school usually makes all the pain worthwhile.
 
==========probat e                 The process of proving in court that the will of someone who has died is valid, and of administ ering the estat e of a dead person.


?
 When her father died, she thought she would be able to avoid probat e, but she wasn't that lucky.


Ever since people have writ t en wills, those wills have had to be proven genuine by a judge. Withouta probat e process, greedy acquaintances or relat ives could writ e up a fake will stat ing thatall the person's wealth belonged to them. To establish a will as genuine, it must generally be wit nessed and stamped by someone officially licensed to do  so  (though  wills  have somet imes been approved even when they were just writ t en on a piece of scrap paper, with no wit nesses). Today we use probate more broadly to mean everything that 's handled in probate court, a special court that oversees the handling of estat es (the money and propert y left when someone dies), making sure that everyone event ually receives what is properly theirs.
 
==========probit y                          Absolut e honest y and upright ness.


?
 Her unquest ioned probit y helped win her the respect of her fellow judges.


Probit y is a qualit y the public generally hopes for in it s elect ed officials but doesn'talways get . Bankers, for example, have tradit ionally been careful to projectan air of probit y, even though banking scandals and bailout s have made this harder than ever. An aura of probit y surrounds such public figures as Warren Buffet tand Bill Moyers, men to whom many Americans would entrust their children and their finances.
 
==========reprobat e
 A person of thoroughly bad charact er.


?
 His wife finally lefthim, claiming he was a reprobat e who would disappear for weeks ata t ime, gambling and drinking away all his money.


The relat ed verb of reprobate is reprove, which originally, as the opposit e of approve, meant "t o condemn." Thus, a reprobat e, as the word was used in Biblical translat ions, was someone condemned to hell. But for many years reprobate has been said in a t one of joshing affect ion, usually to describe someone of doubt ful morals but good humor.  Shakespeare's  great charact er Falstaff-a lazy, lying, boast ful, sponging drunkard-is the model of a reprobat e, but st ill everyone's favorit e Shakespeare charact er.

==========GRAV comes from the Latin word meaning "heavy, weight y, serious." Gravity is, of course, what makes things heavy, and without it there wouldn't be any life on earth, since nothing would stay on earth atall. This doesn't st op us from yelling in outrage when the familiar laws of gravit y cause something to drop to the floor and break.
 
==========grave               (1) Requiring serious thought or concern. (2) Serious and formal in appearance or manner.


?
 We realized that the sit uat ion was grave and that the slight est incident could spark all-out war.


Gravity has a familiar physical meaning butalso a nonphysical meaning-basically "seriousness." Thus, something grave possesses gravit y. You can refer to the gravit y of a person's manner, though public figures t oday seem to have a lot less gravit y than they used to have. Or you can talk abouta grave sit uat ion, as in the example sent ence. But even though Shakespeare makes a pun on grave when a dying charact er talks about being buried the next day ("Ask for me t omorrow and you shall find me a grave man"), the word meaning "hole for burying a body" isn'tact ually relat ed.
 
==========gravitas
 Great or very dignified seriousness.


?
 The head of the commit t ee never failed to carry herself with the gravitas she felt was appropriat e to her office.


This word comes to us straight from Latin. Among the Romans, gravitas was thought to be essent ial to the charact er and funct ions of any adult (male) in authorit y. Even the head of a household or a low-level official would strive for this important qualit y. We use gravitas t oday to ident ify the same solemn dignit y in men and women, but it seems to come easier in those who are over 60, slow-moving-and a bit overweight .
 
==========gravitat e
  To move or be drawn t oward something, especially by nat ural t endency or as if by an invisible force.


?
 On hot evenings, the t own's social life gravitat ed t oward the lakefront , where you could stroll the long piers eat ing ice cream or dance at the old Casino.


To gravitat e is to respond, almost  unconsciously, to a force that  works like gravity to draw things st eadily to itas if by their own weight . Thus, young people gravitat e t oward a role model, moths gravitat e to a flame, a conversat ion might gravitat e t oward polit ics, and everyone ata part y oft en gravitat es to the bar.
 
==========aggravat e                   (1) To make (an injury, problem, et c.) more serious or severe. (2) To annoy or bother.


?
 She went back to the soccer t eam before the knee was complet ely healed, which nat urally aggravat ed the injury.


Since the grav- root  means basically "weight y or serious," the original meaning of aggravate was "t o make more serious." A bad relat ionship with your parent s can be aggravat ed by marrying someone who nobody likes, for example, or a t ouchy trade relat ionship bet ween two countries can be aggravat ed by their inabilit y to agree on climat e-change issues. Depression can be aggravat ed by insomnia-and insomnia can be aggravat ed by depression. But when most people use aggravate t oday, they employ it s "annoy" sense, as in  "What  really aggravat es my dad is having to list en to that TV all day long."
 
==========LEV comes from the Latin adject ive levis, meaning "light ," and the verb levare, meaning "t o raise or light en." So a lever is a bar used to lift something, by means of leverage. And levitation is the magician's trick in which a body seems to rise int o the air by it self.
 
==========alleviat e
To light en, lessen, or relieve, especially physical or mental suffering.


?
 Cold compresses alleviat ed the pain of the physical injury, but only t ime could alleviat e the effect of the insult .


Physical pain or emot ional anguish, or a wat er shortage or traffic congest ion, can all be alleviat ed by providing the appropriat e remedy. But some pain or anguish or shortage or congest ion will remain: to alleviat e is not to cure.
 
==========elevation                      (1) The height of a place. (2) The act or result of lift ing or raising someone or something.


?
 Her doct or is concerned about the elevat ion of her blood pressure since her last visit .


When you're hiking, you may be int erest ed in knowing the highest elevat ion you'll be reaching. Psychologist s use the t erm "mood elevat ion" to mean improvement in a pat ient 's depression, and some leg ailment s require elevat ion of the limb, usually so that it 's higher than the heart for part of each day. Elevation can also mean "promot ion"; thus, a vice president may be elevated to president , or a captain may be elevat ed to admiral.
 
==========cant ilever                         A long piece of wood, metal, et c., that st icks out from a wall to support something above it .


?
 The house's deck, support ed by cant ilevers, jut t ed out dramat ically over the rocky slope, and looking over the edge made him dizzy.


Cant ilevers hold up a surface or room without themselves being support ed at their out er end. Many out door balconies are cantilevered, and theat er balconies may be as well. A cant ilevered bridge may have a huge span (as long as 1,800 feet ) built out on either side of a single large foundat ion pier. Archit ect s somet imes use cant ilevered construct ion to produce  dramat ic effect s; Frank Lloyd Wright 's "Fallingwat er" house, which ext ends out over a rocky river, is a famous example. But the Grand Canyon's "Skywalk" has become perhaps the best -known piece of cant ilevered construct ion in America.
 
==========levit y                      Lack of appropriat e seriousness.


?
 The Puritan elders tried to ban levit y of all sort s from the communit y's meet ings, but found it increasingly difficult to control the younger generat ion.


Levit y originally was thought to be  a physical force exact ly like gravit y but pulling  in the opposit e direct ion, like the helium in a balloon. As recent ly as the 19th cent ury, scient ist s were st ill arguing about it s exist ence. Today levity refers only to light ness in manner. To st ern believers of some religious faiths, levit y is oft en regarded as almost sinful. But the word, like it s synonym frivolity, now has an old-fashioned ring to itand is usually used only half-seriously.

==========Words from Mythology and History

cicerone                   A  guide,  especially  one  who  takes  t ourist s to museums, monument s, or archit ect ural sit es and explains what is being seen.


?
 On Cret e they sought outa highly recommended cicerone, hoping to receive the best possible introduct ion to the not eworthy hist orical sit es.


The Roman stat esman and orat or Cicero was renowned for his elegant st yle and great knowledge (and occasional long-windedness). So 18th-cent ury Italians seem to have given the name cicerone to the guides who would show well-educat ed foreigners around the great cult ural sit es of the ancientroman empire-guides who sought to be as eloquentand informed as Cicero in explaining the world in which he lived.
 
==========hect or                      To bully or harass by blust er or personal pressure.


?
 He would swagger around the apart ment entrance with his friends and hect or the t errified inhabitant s going in and out .


In Homer's great Iliad, Hect or was the leader of the Trojan forces, and the very model of nobilit y and honor. In the Greek war against Troy, he killed several great warriors before being slain by Achilles. His name began to take on it s current meaning only aft er gangs of bullying young rowdies, many of them armed soldiers recent ly released from service following the end of the English Civil War, began t errorizing the resident s of lat e-17th-cent ury London. The gangs t ook such names as the Royst ers, the Blades, the Bucks, and the Bloods, but the best - known of them was called the Hect ors. The names Blades and Hect ors may have seemed appropriat e because, like Hect or and Achilles, they oft en fought with swords.
 
==========hedonism                     An at t it ude or way of life based on the idea that pleasure or happiness should be the chief goal.


?
 In her new spirit of hedonism, she went out for a massage, picked up champagne and chocolat e truffles, and made a dat e that evening with an old boyfriend.


Derived from the Greek word for "pleasure," hedonism over the ages has provided the basis for several philosophies. The ancient Epicureans and the 19th-cent ury Ut ilitarians both taughtand pursued hedonistic principles. Butalthough we generally use the word t oday when talking about immediat e pleasures for the senses, philosophers who talk abouthedonism are usually talking about quiet pleasures thataren't pursued in a selfish way.
 
==========nest or                       A senior figure or leader in one's field.


?
 The guest of honor was a nest or among journalist s, and aft er dinner he shared some of his wisdom with the audience.


Nest or was another charact er from the Iliad, the eldest of the Greek leaders in the Trojan War. A great warrior as a young man, he was now not ed for his wisdom and his talkat iveness, both of which increased as he aged. These days, a nest or is not necessarily long-winded, but merely wise and generous with his advice.
 
==========spartan Marked by simplicit y, avoidance of luxury, and oft en strict self-discipline or self-denial.


?
 When he was single, he had lived a spartan life in a t iny, undecorat ed apart ment with one chair, a table, and a bed.


In ancient t imes, the Greek cit y-stat e of Sparta had a reputat ion for the severe and highly disciplined way of life it enforced among it s cit izens, so as to keep them ready for war atany t ime. Physical training was required for both men and women. A boy would begin his military  training at 7 and would live in army barracks for much of his life, even aft er he was married. Today, when a cargo ship or a remot e beach resort offers "spartan accommodat ions," some  t ourist s jump at the chance for a refreshing change from the luxuries they've been used t o- and no one worries that they'll be forced out of bed at dawn to part icipat e in war games.
 
==========st ent orian
Extremely loud, oft en with especially deep richness of sound.


?
 Even withouta microphone, his st ent orian voice was clearly audible in the lastrows of the audit orium.


St ent or, like Hect or, was a warrior in the Iliad, but on the Greek side. His unusually powerful voice (Homer calls him "brazen-voiced"-that is, with a voice like a brass instrument ) made him the nat ural choice for delivering announcement s and proclamat ions to the assembled Greek army, in an era when there was no way of art ificially increasing the volume of a voice.
 
==========st oic                  Seemingly indifferent to pleasure or pain.


?
 She bore the pain of her broken leg with such st oic pat ience that most of us had no idea she was suffering.


The Stoics were members of a philosophical movement that firstappeared in ancient Greece and  last ed  well  int o  the  Roman  era. Stoicism  taught  that  humans  should  seek to free themselves from joy, grief, and passions of all kinds in order to at tain wisdom; it s t eachings thus have much in common with Buddhism. The great St oics include the stat esman Cicero, the playwright Seneca, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose Meditations is the most famous book of St oic philosophy. Today we admire the kind of st oicism that enables some people (who may never have even heard of Marcus Aurelius) to endure both mental and physical pain without complaint .
 
==========sybarit ic Marked by a luxurious or sensual way of life.


?
 When I knew them they were living a sybarit ic exist ence-hopping from resort to resort , each more splendid than the last -buta year lat er the money ran out .


The ancient cit y of Sybaris (near modern Terranova di Sibari), founded by the Greeks on the  t oe of Italy's "boot ," was famous for the wealth and luxury of it s cit izens in the 6th cent ury B.C. But the Sybarites' wealth made them overconfident , and when they went to war with a nearby cit y, they were defeat ed by a much smaller army. Aft er the vict ory, their enemies divert ed the course of the river running through Sybaris so that it destroyed the whole cit y forever.

MANIA PSYCH CEPT FIN JECT TRACT DUC/DUCT SEQU WordsfromMythology
Quiz2-1 Quiz2-2 Quiz2-3 Quiz2-4 Quiz2-5 ReviewQuizzes2

MANIA in Latin means "madness," and the meaning passed over int o English unchanged. Our word mania can mean a mental illness, or at  least  an excessive enthusiasm. We might  call someone a maniac who was wild, violent , and mentally ill-or maybe justreally enthusiast ic about something. Too  much caffeine  might make  you a  bit manic. But the int ense mood swings once known as manic-depressive illness  are  now  usually  called bipolar  disorder inst ead.
 
==========klept omania
        A mental illness in which a person has a strong desire to st eal things.


?
 Klept omania leads it s sufferers to st eal it ems of lit t le value that they don't need anyway.


Klepto- comes from the Greek word kleptein, "t o st eal." Even though klept omania is oft en the but t of jokes, it 's act ually a  serious mental illness, oft en  associat ed  with mood  disorders, anxiet y disorders, eat ing disorders, and substance abuse. Klepot omaniacs t end to be depressed, and many live lives of secret shame because they're afraid to seek treat ment .
 
==========dipsomaniac
       A person with an extreme and uncontrollable desire for alcohol.


?
 She didn't like the word alcoholic being applied to her, and liked dipsomaniac even less.


Dipsomaniac comes from the Greek noun dipsa, "thirst ," but thirst usually has nothing to do with it . Some expert s dist inguish bet ween an alcoholic and a dipsomaniac, reserving dipsomaniac for someone involved in frequent episodes of binge drinking and blackout s. In any case, there are plent y of less respect ful words for a person of similar habit s: sot, lush, wino, souse, boozer, guzzler, tippler, tosspot, drunkard, boozehound--the list goes on and on and on.
 
==========megalomaniac
    A mental disorder marked by feelings of great personal power and importance.


?
 When the governor start ed calling for arming his Nat ional Guard with nuclear weapons, the vot ers finally realized they had elect ed a megalomaniac.


Since the Greek root megalo- means "large," someone who is megalomaniacal has a mental disorder marked by feelings of personal grandeur. Megalomania has probably afflict ed many rulers throughouthist ory: The Roman emperor Caligula insist ed thathe be worshipped as a living god. Joseph Stalin suffered from the paranoia that oft en accompanies megalomania, and had thousands of his countrymen execut ed as a result . J.-B. Bokassa, dictat or of a small and extremely poor African nat ion, proclaimed himself emperor of the country he renamed the Central African Empire. And even democrat ically elect ed leaders have oft en acquired huge egos as a result of public acclaim. But megalomaniac is generally thrown around as an insultand rarely refers to real mental illness.
 
==========egomaniac
Someone who is extremely self-cent ered and ignores the problems and concerns of others.


?
 He's a complet ely unimpressive person, but that doesn't keep him from being an egomaniac.


Ego is Latin for "I," and in English ego usually means "sense of self-worth." Most people's egos stay ata healthy level, but some become exaggerat ed. Egomaniacs may display a grandiose sense of self-importance, with fantasies about their own brilliance or beaut y, int ense envy of others, a lack of sympathy, and a need to be adored or feared. But , like megalomaniac, the word egomaniac is thrown around by lot s of people who don't mean much more by it than blowhard or know-it-all.
 
==========PSYCH comes from the Greek word psyche, meaning "breath, life, soul." Psychology is the science of mind and behavior, and a psychologist treat s or st udies the mental problems of individuals and groups. Psychiatry is a branch of medicine that deals with mental and emot ional disorders, and a psychiatrist (like any other doct or) may prescribe drugs to treat them.
 
==========psyche                Soul, personalit y, mind.


?
 Analyst s are constant ly trying to understand the nat ion's psyche and why the U.S. oft en behaves so different ly from other countries.


Somet ime back in the 16th cent ury, we borrowed the word psyche direct ly from Greek int o English. In Greek mythology, Psyche was a beaut iful princess who fell in love with Eros (Cupid), god of love, and went through t errible trials before being allowed to marry him. The st ory is oft en underst ood to be about the soul redeeming it self through love. (To the Greeks, psyche also meant "but t erfly," which suggest s how they imagined the soul.) In English, psyche oft en sounds less spirit ual than soul, less int ellect ual than mind, and more privat e than personality.
 
==========psychedelic                   (1) Of  or relat ing to a  drug  (such  as  LSD) that  produces abnormal and oft en extreme mental effect s such as hallucinat ions. (2) Imitat ing the effect s of psychedelic drugs.


?
 In her only psychedelic experience, back in 1970, she had wat ched with horror as the walls began crawling with bizarrely colored creat ures.


The most famous-or not orious-of the psychedelic drugs is LSD, a compound that can be obtained from various mushrooms and other fungi but is usually creat ed in the lab. The other well-known psychedelics are psilocybin (likewise obtained from fungi) and mescaline (obtained from peyot e cact us). How psychedelics produce their effect s is st ill fairly myst erious, part ly because research ceased for almost 20 years because of their reputat ion, but scient ist s are det ermined to find the answers and much research is now under way. Psychedelics are now used to treatanxiet y in pat ient s with cancer, and are being t est ed in the treat ment of such serious condit ions as severe depression, alcoholism, and drug addict ion.
 
==========psychosomat ic
   Caused by mental or emot ional problems rather than by physical illness.


?
 Her doct or assumed her st omach problems were psychosomat ic but gave her some harmless medicat ion anyway.


Since the Greek word soma means "body," psychosomatic suggest s the link bet ween mind and body. Since one's mental stat e may have an important effect on one's physical stat e, research on new medicines always involves giving some pat ient s in the experimenta placebo (fake medicine), and some who receive the sugar pills will seem to improve. You may hear someone say of someone else's sympt oms, "Oh, it 's probably just  psychosomat ic," implying that the physical pain or illness is imaginary-maybe justan at t empt to get sympathy-and that the person could will itaway if he or she want ed t o. But this can be harsh and unfair, since, what ever the cause is, the pain is usually real.
 
==========psychotherapist
   One who treat s mental or emot ional disorder or relat ed bodily ills by psychological means.


?
 He's get t ing medicat ion from a psychiatrist , but  it 's his sessions with the psychotherapist thathe really values.


Many psychologist s offer psychological counseling, and psychological counseling can usually be called psychotherapy, so many psychologist s can be called psychotherapist s. The most int ense form of psychotherapy, called psychoanalysis, usually requires several visit s a week. A compet ing t ype of therapy known as behavior therapy focuses on changing a person's behavior (oft en some individual habit such as st ut t ering, t ics, or phobias) without looking very deeply int o his or her mental stat e.

==========CEPT comes from the Latin verb meaning "take, seize." Capture, which is whata captor has done to a captive, has the same meaning. Captivate once meant lit erally "capt ure," but now means only to capt ure mentally through charm or appeal. But in some other English words this root produces, such as those below, it s meaning is harder to find.
 
==========recept ion                    (1) The act of receiving. (2) A social gathering where guest s are formally welcomed.


?
 Although the recept ion of her plan by the board of direct ors was enthusiast ic, it was months before anything was done about it .


Reception is the noun form of receive. So ata formal recept ion, guest s are received or welcomed or "taken in." A bad TV recept ion means the signal isn't being received well. When a new novel receives good reviews, we say ithas met with a good crit ical recept ion. If it get s a poor recept ion, on the other hand, that 's the same as saying that it wasn't well-received.
 
==========int ercept
  To st op, seize, or int errupt (something or someone) before arrival.


?
 The explosives had been int ercept ed by police just before being loaded ont o the jet .


Since the prefix inter means "bet ween" (see INTER), it 's nothard to see how intercept was creat ed. Arms shipment s coming to a country are somet imes int ercept ed, but such interceptions can somet imes be underst ood as act s of war. In foot ball, soccer, and basket ball, players try to int ercept the ball as it 's being passed by the other t eam. In years gone by, let t ers and document s being carried bet ween officers or officials were somet imes int ercept ed when the carrier was  caught ;  t oday, when  these  communicat ions  are  generally  electronic, an int ercept ed e-mail isn'tact ually st opped, but simply read secret ly by a third part y.
 
==========percept ible
  Not iceable or able to be felt by the senses.


?
 Her change in at t it ude t oward him was barely percept ible, and he couldn't be sure he wasn't just imagining it .


Perceptible includes the prefix per-, meaning "through," so the word refers to what ever can be taken in through the senses. A perceptive person picks up minor changes, small clues, or hint s and shades of meaning that others can't perceive, so one person's perception-a t iny sound, a slight change in the weather, a different t one of voice-oft en won't be percept ible to another.
 
==========suscept ible
(1)  Open to some  influence; responsive. (2) Able to be submit t ed to an act ion or process.


?
 She impressed everyone immediat ely with her int elligence, so they're now highly suscept ible to her influence and usually go along with anything she proposes.


With it s prefix sus-, "up," susceptible refers to something or someone that "takes up" or absorbs like a sponge. A sickly child may be suscept ible to colds, and an unlucky adult may be suscept ible to back problems. A lonely elderly person may be suscept ible to whata con man t ells him or her on the phone. And st udent s are usually suscept ible to the t eaching of an imaginat ive professor-that is, likely to enjoy and learn from it .
 
==========FIN comes from the Latin word for "end" or "boundary." Final describes last things, and a finale or a finish is an ending. (And at the end of a French film, you may just see the word "Fin.") But it s meaning is harder to trace in some of the other English words derived from it .
 
==========confine                     (1) To keep (someone or something) within limit s. (2) To hold (someone) in a locat ion.


?
 He had heard the bad news from the CEO, but when he spoke to his employees he confined his remarks to a few hint s that sales had slipped.


Confine means basically to keep someone or something within borders. Someone confined to a bedroom or a wheelchair is t oo ill or disabled to be anywhere else. A person under "house arrest " is confined to his or her house by the government . Ata business meet ing, the discussion may be confined to a single t opic. A t own may keep industrial development confined to one area by means of zoning. And someone confined to the stat e prison for 20 years has probably commit t ed quit e a serious crime.
 
==========definit ive                           (1) Authoritat ive and final. (2) Specifying perfect ly or precisely.


?
 The t eam's brilliantresearch provided a definit ive descript ion of the virus and it s strange mutat ion pat t erns.


Something definit ive is complet e and final. A definit ive example is the perfect example. A definit ive answer is usually a strong yes or no. A definit ive biography contains everything we'll ever need to know about someone. Ella Fit zgerald's famous 1950s recordings of American songs have even been called definit ive-but no one ever want ed them to be the last .
 
==========finit e                Having definit e limit s.


?
 Her ambit ions were infinit e, buther wealth was finit e.


Ithas  come  as  a  shock to many  of  us to realize  that  resources  such  as  oil-and  the at mosphere's abilit y to absorb greenhouse gases-are finit e rather than unlimit ed. The debat e cont inues as to whether the universe is finit e or infinite and, if it 's finit e, how to think about what lies beyond it . Religion has always concerned it self with the quest ion of the finit e (that is, human life on earth) versus the infinit e (God, et ernit y, and infinit y). But finite is most ly used in scient ific writ ing, oft en with the meaning "definit ely measurable."
 
==========infinit esimal
          Extremely or immeasurably small.


?
 Looking more closely at the research data, he now saw an odd pat t ern of changes so infinit esimal that they hadn't been not iced before.


Justas infinite describes something immeasurable ("without limit "), infinitesimal describes something endlessly small. When Ant onie van Leeuwenhoek invent ed the microscope in the 17th cent ury, he was able to see organisms thathad been thought t oo infinitesimally small to exist . But t oday's electron microscope allows us to see infinit esimal aspect s of mat t er that even Leeuwenhoek could nothave imagined.

==========JECT comes from jacere, the Latin verb meaning "throw" or "hurl." To reject something is to throw (or push) it back; to eject something is to throw (or drive) it out ; and to inject something is to throw (or squirt ) it int o something else.
 
==========int erject
To int errupta conversat ion with a comment or remark.


?
 His anger was growing as he list ened to the conversat ion, and every so oft en he would int erjecta crude comment .


According to it s Latin root s, interject ought to mean lit erally "throw bet ween." For most of the word's hist ory, however, the only things thathave been int erject ed have been comment s dropped suddenly int o a conversat ion. Interjections are oft en humorous, and somet imes even insult ing, and the best int erject ions are so quick that the conversat ion isn't even int errupt ed.
 
==========conject ure
     To guess.


?
 He was lastheard of in Bogot, and they conject ured thathe had methis end in the Andes at the hands of the guerrillas.


Formed with the prefix con-, "t ogether," conjecture means lit erally "t o throw t ogether"-that is, to produce a theory by put t ing t ogether a number of  fact s. So, for  example, Columbus conject ured from his calculat ions thathe would reach Asia if he sailed west ward, and his lat er conjecture that there was a "Northwest Passage" by sea from the At lant ic to the Pacific over the North American cont inent was proved correct cent uries lat er.
 
==========project ion
    An est imat e of what mighthappen in the fut ure based on what is happening now.

?
 The presidenthas been hearing different deficit project ions all week from the members of his economic t eam.

Projection has various meanings, but what they all have in common is that something is sent out or forward. A movie is projected ont o a screen; a skilled actress project s her voice out int o a large theat er without seeming to shout ; and something st icking out from a wall can be called a project ion. But the meaning we focus on here is the one used by businesses and government s. Most project ions of this kind are est imat es of a company's sales or profit s-or of the finances of a t own, stat e, or country-somet ime in the fut ure.
 
==========traject ory                       The curved path thatan object makes in space, or thata thrown object follows as itrises and falls to earth.

?
 Considering the likely range, traject ory, and accuracy of a bullet fired from a cheap handgun at 100 yards, the murder seemed incredible.

Formed with part  of the prefix trans-, "across," trajectory means a "hurling  across."  By calculat ing the effect of gravit y and other forces, the traject ory of an object launched int o space ata known speed can be comput ed precisely. Missiles stand a chance of hit t ing their target only if their traject ory has been plot t ed accurat ely. The word is used most oft en in physics and engineering, but notalways; we can also say, for example, that the traject ory of a whole life may be set in a person's youth, or thata new book traces the long traject ory of the French empire.
 
==========TRACT comes from trahere, the Latin verb meaning "drag or draw." Something attractive draws us t oward it . Something distracting pulls your at t ent ion away. And when you extract something from behind the sofa, you drag it out .
 
==========tract ion                         The  frict ion  that  allows a  moving  thing to move  over a  surface without slipping.

?
 The spinning wheels were get t ing no tract ion on the ice, and we began to slip backward down the hill.


A tractor is something that pulls something else. We usually use the word for a piece of farm machinery, but it 's also the name of the part of a big truck that includes the engine and the cab. Tract ors get t errific tract ion, because of their powerful engines and the deep ridges on their huge wheels. A cross-country skier needs tract ion to kick herself forward, but doesn't want it to slow her down when she's gliding, so the bot t om of the skis may have a "fish-scale" surface that permit s both of these at the same t ime.
 
==========retract             (1) To  pull back  (something) int o  something  larger. (2) To  take  back (something said or writ t en).


?
 She was forced to retracther commentabouther opponentaft er it was condemned in the press.


The prefix re- ("back") gives retract the meaning of "draw back." Justas a catretract s it s claws int o it s paws when they aren't being used, a public figure may issue a retraction in order to say thathe or she no longer want s to say something thathas just been said. But it 's somet imes hard to know whata retract ion means: Was the original stat ementan error or an outright lie?
 Somet imes a polit ician even has to retract something that everyone act ually assumes is the truth. Thousands of cit izens were forced to publicly retract their "wrong" ideas by the Soviet government in the 1930s and the Chinese government in the 1960s. Someone wrongly accused may demand a retract ion from his accuser-though t oday it seems more likely thathe'll just go ahead and sue.
 
==========protract ed
    Drawn out , cont inued, or ext ended.


?
 No one was looking forward to a protract ed struggle for cust ody of the baby.


With  it s  prefix pro-, "forward," protracted usually applies to something drawn out  forward in t ime. A protract ed strike may cripple a company; a protract ed rainy spell may rot the root s of vegetables; and a protract ed lawsuit occasionally out lives the part ies involved. Before the invent ion of the polio vaccines, polio's many vict ims had no choice but to suffer a protract ed illness and it s aft ereffect s.
 
==========intractable
Not easily handled, led, taught , or controlled.


?
 Corrupt ion in the army was the country's intractable problem, and for many years all foreign aid had ended up in the colonels' pocket s.


Intractable simply means "untreatable," and even comes from the same root . The word may describe both people and condit ions. A cancer pat ient may suffer intractable pain that doct ors are unable to treat . An intractable alcoholic goes back to the bot t le immediat ely aft er "drying out ." Homelessness, though ithardly exist ed thirt y years ago, is now somet imes regarded as an intractable problem.

==========DUC/DUCT, from the Latin verb ducere, "t o lead," shows up regularly in English. Duke means basically "leader." The Italian dictat or Mussolini was known simply as Il Duce, "the leader." But such words as produce and reduce also contain the root , even though their meanings show it less clearly.
 
==========conducive
 Tending to promot e, encourage, or assist ; helpful.


?
 She found the at mosphere in the quiet caf conducive to st udy and even to creat ive thinking.


Something conducive "leads t o" a desirable result . A cozy living room may be conducive to relaxed conversat ion, justas a boardroom may be conducive to more int ense discussions. Part icular tax policies are oft en conducive to savings and invest ment , whereas others are conducive to consumer spending. Not ice that conducive is almostalways followed by to.
 
==========deduct ion
      (1) Subtract ion. (2) The reaching of a conclusion by reasoning.


?
 Foret elling the fut ure by deduct ion based on a polit ical or economic theory has proved to be extremely difficult .


To deduct is simply to subtract . A tax deduct ion is a subtract ion from your taxable income allowed by the government for certain expenses, which will result in your paying lower taxes. Your insurance deductible is the amount of a medical bill that the insurance company makes you subtract before it start s to pay-in other words, the amount that will come out of your own pocket . But deduction also means "reasoning," and part icularly reasoning based on general principles to produce specific findings. Mathemat ical reasoning is almostalways deduct ion, for instance, since it is based on general rules. But when Dr. Wat son exclaims "Brilliant deduct ion, my dear Holmes!" he simply means "brilliantreasoning," since Sherlock Holmes's solut ions are based on specific details he has not iced rather than on general principles.
 
==========induce                   (1) Persuade, influence. (2) Bring about .


?
 To induce him to make the call we had to promise we wouldn't do itagain.


Inducing is usually gent le persuasion; you may, for instance, induce a friend to go to a concert , or induce a child to st op crying. An inducement is something that  might  lure  you to do something, though inducement s are occasionally a bit menacing, like the Godfather's offer that you can'trefuse. Induce also somet imes means "produce"; thus, doct ors mustat t imes induce labor in a pregnant woman. Not ice that inductand induction are somewhat different from induce and inducement, though they come from the ident ical root s.
 
==========seduct ion
      (1)  Temptat ion to sin,  especially   t emptat ion to sexual int ercourse. (2) At tract ion or charm.


?
 The company began it s campaign of seduct ion of the smaller firm by invit ing it s t op management to a series of weekends at expensive resort s.


Seduction, with it s prefix se-, "aside," means basically "lead aside or astray." In Hawthorne's novel The Scarlet Letter, Hest er Prynne is forced to wear a large scarleta, for "adult eress," aft er it  is revealed that  she's been seduced by the Reverend Dimmesdale. Seduct ion also takes less physical forms. Advert isement s constant ly try to seduce us (oft en using sex as a t emptat ion) int o buying product s we hadn't even known exist ed.
 
==========SEQU comes from the Latin verb sequi, meaning  "t o  follow." A sequel follows the original novel, film, or t elevision show.
 
==========sequent ial
     (1) Arranged in order or in a series. (2) Following in a series.


?
 In writ ing the hist ory of the revolut ion, his challenge was to putall the event s of those fat eful days in proper sequent ial order.


Things in sequence, or regular order, are arranged sequentially. Most novels and films move sequent ially, but some use t echniques such as flashbacks that int errupt the movement forward in t ime. Sequent ial courses in college must follow each other in the proper order, just like sequent ial tasks or st eps.
 
==========subsequent
      Following in t ime, order, or place; lat er.


?
 Through all her subsequent love affairs, she never st opped thinking about the man who gotaway.


The prefix sub- normally means "below," and the sub- in subsequent seems to imply that everything aft er the first is somehow inferior. As the definit ion stat es, subsequent can refer to t ime ("All our subsequentat t empt s to contacther failed"), order ("The subsequenthouses on the list looked even worse"), or place ("The subsequent villages on the river heading east become st eadily  more  primit ive"). But subsequently, as in "I subsequent ly learned the real st ory," simply means "lat er."
 
==========consequent ial
           (1) Result ing. (2) Important .


?
 None of our discussions thus far has been very consequent ial; next week's meet ing will be the important one.


Something consequent ial follows or comes along with something else. The "result ing" meaning of consequential is usually seen in legal writ ing. For example, "consequent ial losses" are losses that supposedly result ed from some improper behavior, about which the lawyer's client is suing. But normally consequential means "significant " or "important ," and it 's especially used for event s that will produce large consequences, or result s.
 
==========non sequit ur                          A stat ement that does not follow logically from anything previously said.


?
 Rat t led by the quest ion, his mind went blank, and he blurt ed outa non sequit ur that fet ched a few laughs from members of the audience.


Non sequitur is act ually a complet e sent ence in Latin, meaning "It does not follow"-that is, something said or writ t en doesn't logically follow what came before it . It was Arist ot le who ident ified the non sequit ur as one of the basic fallacies of logic-that is, one of the ways in which a person's reasoning may go wrong. For Arist ot le, the non sequit ur is usually a conclusion that doesn'tact ually result from the reasoning and evidence present ed. Somet ime when you're list ening to polit icians answering quest ions, see how many non sequit urs you can spot .

==========Words from Mythology

Apollonian
  Harmonious, ordered, rat ional, calm.


?
 Aft er a cent ury of Romant ic emot ion, some composers adopt ed a more Apollonian st yle, producing clearly pat t erned pieces thatavoided extremes of all kinds.


In Greek mythology, Apollo was the god of the sun, light , prophecy, and music, and the mostrevered of all the gods. Part ly because of the writ ings of Niet zsche, we now oft en think of Apollo (in contrast to the god Dionysus) as a model of calm reason, and we may call anything with those qualit ies Apollonian. This isn't  the whole st ory aboutapollo, however; he had a t errible t emper and could be viciously cruel when he felt like it .
 
==========bacchanalian
  Frenzied, orgiast ic.


?
 The bacchanalian part ying on graduat ion nightresult ed in three wrecked cars, two lawsuit s by unamused parent s, and more new experiences than most of the part icipant s could remember the next day.


The Roman god of drama, wine, and ecstasy, Bacchus was the focus of a widespread celebrat ion, the Bacchanalia. The fest ivit ies were originally secret , and only init iat ed members could part icipat e. There was wine in abundance, and part icipant s were expect ed to cut loose from normal restraint s and give in to all sort s of wild desires. Event ually the Bacchanalia became more public and uncontrolled, finally get t ing so out of hand that in 186 B.C. the Roman authorit ies had it banned. Much the same bacchanalian spirit fills tropical carnivals every year, including New Orleans' Mardi Gras.
 
==========delphic                   Unclear, ambiguous, or confusing.


?
 All she could get from the strange old woman were a few delphic comment s that lefther more confused than ever about the missing document s.


Delphi in Greece was the sit e of a t emple to Apollo at which there resided an oracle, a woman through whom Apollo would speak, foret elling the fut ure. The Greeks consult ed the oracle frequent ly on mat t ers both privat e and public. The prophecies were given in difficult  poetry thathad to be int erpret ed by priest s, and even the int erpretat ions  could  be  hard to understand. When Croesus, king of Lydia, asked what would happen if he at tacked the Persians, the oracle announced thathe would destroy a great empire; what she didn't say was that the empire destroyed would be his own. Modern-day descendant s of the oracle include some polit ical commentat ors, who ut t er words of delphic complexit y every week.
 
==========Dionysian
  Frenzied, delirious.


?
 Only in the tropics did such fest ivals become truly Dionysian, he said, which was why he was booking his flight to Rio.


Dionysus was the Greek forerunner of Bacchus. He was the invent or of wine, which he gave to the human race. For that giftand for all the wild behavior that it led t o, Dionysus became immensely popular, and he appears in a great many myths. He is oft en shown holding a wine goblet , with his hair full of vine leaves, and at t ended by a band of goat -foot ed sat yrs and wild female spirit s called maenads. In the 19th cent ury, scholars such as Niet zsche claimed that the ancient world could be underst ood as a cont inuing conflict bet ween the at t it udes represent ed by Apollo (see Apollonian) and Dionysus-that is, bet ween order and disorder, bet ween moderat ion and excess, bet ween the controlled and the ecstat ic.
 
==========jovial                     Jolly, good-nat ured.


?
 Their grandfather was as jovial and sociable as their grandmother was quietand withdrawn.


Jove, or Jupit er, was the Roman count erpart of the Greek's Zeus, and like Zeus was regarded as chief among the gods. When the Romans were naming the planet s, they gave the name Jupit er to the one that , as they may have already known, was the largest of all (though only the second-bright est to the naked eye). When the pract ice of astrology reached the Roman empire from the East , astrologers declared that those "born under Jupit er" were dest ined to be merry and generous, and many cent uries lat er this would result in the words jovial and joviality.
 
==========mercurial
Having rapid and unpredictable changes of mood.


?
 His mother's always mercurial t emper became even more unpredictable, to the point where the slight est thing would trigger a violent fit .


The god Mercury, with his winged cap and sandals, was the very symbol of speed, and the planet Mercury was named for him by the Romans because it is the fast est -moving of the planet s. His name was also given to the liquid silver metal that skit t ers around on a surface so quickly and unpredictably. And the word mercurial seems to have come from the metal, rather than direct ly from the god (or an astrologer's view of the planet 's influence). Mercurial people are usually bright but impulsive and changeable (and somet imes a bit unstable).
 
==========Olympian
   Loft y, superior, and detached.


?
 Now 77, he moved slowly and spoke to the younger lawyers in Olympian t ones, buthis college friends could remember when he was a brash, crazy risk-taker.


The Greek gods lived high at op Mt . Olympus, which allowed them to wat ch what went on in the human realm below and int ervene as they saw fit . They insist ed on being properly worshipped by humans, but otherwise t ended to treat the affairs of these weak and short - lived creat ures almost like a sport . So Olympian describes someone who seems "loft y" and "above itall," as if surveying a scene in which other people appear the size of ant s. The Olympic Games were first celebrat ed in the 8th cent ury B.C., at the religious sit e called Olympia (far from Mt . Olympus), and Olympian t oday act ually most oft en refers to Olympic athlet es.
 
==========venereal
Having to do with sexual int ercourse or diseases transmit t ed by it .


?
 In the 19th cent ury syphilis especially was oft en fatal, and venereal diseases killed some of the great est figures of the t ime.


Venus was the Roman goddess of love, the equivalent of the Greek Aphrodit e. Since she governed all aspect s of love and desire, a word derived from her name was given to the diseases acquired through sexual contact . Most of these venereal diseases have been around for many cent uries, but only in the 20th cent ury did doct ors devise t est s to ident ify them or medicines to cure them. Today the official t erm is sexually transmitted disease, or STD; but even this name t urns out to be ambiguous, since some of these diseases can be contract ed in other ways as well.

AMBI EPI HYP/HYPO THERM/THERMO POLY PRIM HOM/HOMO DIS LatinBorrowings
Quiz3-1 Quiz3-2 Quiz3-3 Quiz3-4 Quiz3-5 ReviewQuizzes3

AMBI means "on both sides" or "around"; ambi- comes from Latin. Most of us are either right - handed or left -handed, butambidextrous people can use their rightand lefthand equally well.
 
==========ambiguous
    (1) Doubt ful or uncertain especially from being obscure or indist inct . (2) Unclear in meaning because of being understandable in more than one way.


?
 Successful polit icians are good at giving ambiguous answers to quest ions on difficult issues.


Ambiguous comes from the Latin verb ambigere, "t o be undecided." When we say someone's eyes are an ambiguous color, we mean we cannot decide which color they are-blue or green?
 Th e ambiguity of the Mona Lisa's smile makes us wonder what she's thinking about . An ambiguous order is one that can be taken in at least two ways; on the other hand, the order "Shut up!" may be rude butat least it 's unambiguous.
 
==========ambient
 Exist ing or present on all sides.


?
 The ambient light ing in the restaurant was low, and there was a bright candle at each table.


Ambient light is the light that fills an area or surrounds something that 's being viewed, like a t elevision screen or a paint ing. Scient ist s somet imes refer to the ambient  t emperat ure, the t emperat ure of the surrounding air. "Ambient music" is the t erm used t oday for "at mospheric" background music usually int ended for relaxat ion or meditat ion. The candlelitrestaurant in the example sent ence is probably trying for a romant ic ambience, or "at mosphere."
 
==========ambivalent
(1) Holding opposit e feelings and at t it udes at the same t ime t oward someone or something. (2) Cont inually wavering bet ween opposit es or alt ernat ive courses of act ion.


?
 He was ambivalentabout the trip: he badly want ed to travel buthat ed to miss the summer act ivit ies athome.


Ambivalent is a fairly new word, less than a hundred years old, and, not surprisingly, it was first used by psychologist s. Since being ambivalent means simply having mixed feelings about some quest ion or issue, some of us spend most of our lives in a stat e of ambivalence. We might feel ambivalence aboutaccept ing a high-paying job thatrequires us to work long hours, about lending money to someone we like but don't know well-or about ordering a Tut t i-Frut t i Chocolat e Banana Sundae El Supremo aft er we've been starving on a strict diet for weeks.
 
==========ambit                      The range or limit covered by something (such as a law).


?
 The treat ment of farm animals generally falls out side the ambit of animal-cruelt y laws in the U.S.


Ambit is a rather formal t erm, oft en used by lawyers, as in, "With this new legislat ion, t obacco now falls within the ambit of FDA regulat ion." Italmostalways refers to something abstractrather than an act ual physical range. So, for example, an immigrant might live complet ely within the ambit of her immigrant communit y unt il she start ed college, where she might find herself in a much broader social ambit . Most of the Latin American colonies were established by Spain, but in the 19th cent ury, as the U.S. became stronger and Spain became weaker, they began to ent er the ambit of U.S. power.
 
==========EPI is a Greek prefix that may mean various things, but usually "on, over" or "at tached t o." So an earthquake's epicenter is the ground right over the cent er of the quake. And your epidermis is the out er layer of your skin, on t op of the inner dermis.
 
==========epilogue                         The final sect ion aft er the main part of a book or play.


?
 Her edit or t old her the book really needed an epilogue, to t ell where each member of the family is t oday.


From it s Greek root s, epilogue means basically "words at tached (at the end)." An epilogue oft en somehow wraps up a st ory's act ion, as in the one for a famous Shakespeare play that ends, "For never was a st ory of more woe / Than this of Julietand her Romeo." In nonfict ion books, we now oft en use the t erm afterword inst ead of epilogue, justas we now generally use foreword inst ead of prologue (see LOG). Movies also oft en have a kind of epilogue-maybe a scene aft er the excit ing climax when the surviving lovers meet in a caf to talk about their fut ure. The epilogue of a musical composit ion, aft er all the drama is over, is called the coda (Italian for "tail").
 
==========epiphyt e             A plant that obtains it s nutrient s from the air and the rain and usually grows on another plant for support .


?
 The strangler fig begins life as an epiphyt e on a tree branch, drops it s t endrils to take root in the ground around the trunk, and slowly covers and strangles the tree to death.


Epiphytic plant s are somet imes known as "air plant s" because they seemingly survive on thin air. They rely on their  host plant s merely for  physical support , not nourishment . Tropical epiphyt es include orchids, ferns, and members of the pineapple family. To a newcomer in the  tropical rain forest , the first sight of a great tree with large epiphyt es hanging from every level can be eerie and ast onishing. Familiar epiphyt es of the t emperat e zone include lichens, mosses, and algae, which may grow on rocks or wat er without t ouching the soil.
 
==========epitaph                      An inscript ion on a grave or t omb in memory of the one buried there.


?
 The greatarchit ect Christ opher Wren designed London's majest ic St . Paul's Cathedral, the sit e of his t omb and epitaph: "Si monument um requiris, circumspice" ("If you seek my monument , look around you").


Epitaph includes the root from the Greek word taphos, "t omb" or "funeral."  Tradit ionally, epitaph refers to a t ombst one inscript ion, but it can also refer to brief memorial stat ement s thatresemble such inscript ions. One of the most famous is Henry Lee's epitaph for George Washingt on: "First in war, first in peace, and first in the heart s of his countrymen."
 
==========epithet                         (1) A descript ive word or phrase occurring with or in place of the name of a person or thing. (2) An insult ing or demeaning word or phrase.


?
 King Richard I of England earned the epithet "Lionheart ed," while his brother, King John, was given the epithet "Lackland."


From it s Greek root s, epithet would mean something "put on," or added. Somet imes the added name follows a given name, as in Erik the Red or Billy the Kid. In other cases, the epithet precedes the personal name, as in Mahat ma ("Great -souled") Gandhi. In st ill others, it 's used in place of the act ual name, as in El Greco ("The Greek") or El Cid ("The Lord"). In it s other common meaning, an epithet is a mocking or insult ing name (like "Lackland" in the example sent ence). When enemies are said to be "hurling epithet s" at each other, it means they're exchanging angry insult s.

==========HYP/HYPO is a Greek prefix meaning "below, under." Many hypo- words are medical. A hypodermic needle inject s medicat ion under the skin. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, can be justas unhealthy as the bet t er-known hypertension, or high blood pressure.
 
==========hypochondriac
     A person overly concerned with his or her own health who oft en suffers from delusions of physical disease.


?
 Hercule Poirot , the det ect ive hero of the Agatha Christ ie myst eries, is a not orious hypochondriac, always trying to prot ecthimself from draft s.


One disease a hypochondriac really does suffer from is hypochondria, the anxiet y and depression that come from worrying t oo much about one's own health. Even though it 's easy to joke abouthypochondriacs, hypochondria is no joking mat t er for the sufferer. Somewhat surprisingly, the second part of hypochondria derives from chondros, the  Greek  word  for "cart ilage." The cart ilage in quest ion is that of the st ernum, or breast bone. From ancient t imes, doct ors believed that certain int ernal organs or regions were the seat of various diseases, both physical and mental, and the area under the breast bone was thought to be the source of hypochondria.
 
==========hypoglycemia
         Abnormal decrease of sugar in the blood.


?
 She had been controlling her hypoglycemia through dietand vitamins, but she now realized she needed to add daily exercise as well.


The root glyk- means "sweet " in Greek, so glyc shows up in the names of various t erms referring to a sugar as a chemical ingredient , such as glycerine and monoglyceride. People with diabet es have difficult y controlling the sugar in their blood. Too lit t le can be dangerous; it s early sympt oms may be as minor as nervousness, shaking, and sweat ing, but it can lead to seizures and unconsciousness. Luckily, it can be taken care of easily by eat ing or drinking something high in carbohydrat es. It s opposit e, hyperglycemia (see HYPER), is the main sympt om of diabet es, and usually requires an inject ion of insulin, which the sufferer usually gives himself. Today many people-though not doct ors-use hypoglycemia to mean a complet ely different condit ion, with some of the same milder sympt oms, that doesn't involve low blood sugar.
 
==========hypothermia
      Subnormal t emperat ure of the body.


?
 By the t ime rescuers were able to pull the boy from the pond's icy wat ers, hypothermia had reached a life-threat ening stage.


Hypothermia, which usually result s from submersion in icy wat er or prolonged exposure to cold, may const it ut e a grave medical emergency. It begins to be a concern when body t emperat ure dips below 95F, and the pulse, breathing, and blood pressure start to decline. Below 90, the pointat which the normal react ion of shivering ceases, emergency treat ment is called for.
 
==========hypothet ical
(1)  Involving  an  assumpt ion  made  for  the  sake  of argument or for further st udy or invest igat ion. (2) Imagined for purposes of example.


?
 The candidat e refused to say what she would do if faced with a hypothet ical military crisis.


The noun hypothesis comes straight from the Greek word meaning "foundat ion" or "base"- that is something "put under" something else. So a hypothesis is something you assume to be true in order that you can use itas the base or basis for a line of reasoning-and any such assumpt ion can be called hypothet ical. So, for example, the theory that the dinosaurs became ext inct because of a giant met eor that struck the earth near the Yucat n Peninsula involves the hypothesis that such a collision would have had such t errible effect s on the earth's climat e that the great  rept iles would have been doomed. Once a hypothesis has been thoroughly st udied and researched without being proved wrong, it generally comes to be called a theory inst ead.
 
==========THERM/THERMO comes from the Greek word meaning "warm." A thermometer measures the amount of warmth in a body, the air, or an oven. A thermostat makes sure the t emperat ure stays at the same level. And it 's easy to see why the German manufact urers of a vacuum- insulat ed bot t le back in 1904 gave it the name Thermos.
 
==========thermal                      (1) Of, relat ing t o, or caused by heat . (2) Designed to insulat e in order to retain body heat .


?
 A special weave called thermal weave traps insulat ing air in lit t le pocket s to increase the warmth of long underwear and blanket s.


In days gone by, much of the male populat ion of the northern stat es in the cold months would wear a garment of thermal underwear covering the ent ire body, called a union suit . Union suit s kept sodbust ers, cowboys, and t ownsfolk alike not only warm butalso it chy and a lit t le on the smelly side (back when bathing once a week was considered the height of  cleanliness). Thermal imaging is phot ography that  capt ures  "heat  pict ures"-rather than ordinary  light pict ures-of object s. And thermal pollut ion occurs when industrial wat er use ends up warming a river in a damaging way. Small-plane pilot s use thermal as a noun for a warm updraft , oft en over a plowed field or desert , that lift s their wings, justas it enables hawks to soar upward without moving their wings.
 
==========thermodynamics
            Physics that deals with the mechanical act ions or relat ions of heat .


?
 With his college major in electrical engineering, he assumed it would be an easy st ep to a graduat e-school concentrat ion in thermodynamics.


Thermodynamics (see DYNAM) is based on the fact thatall forms of energy, including heatand mechanical energy, are basically the same. Thus, it deals with the ways in which one form of  energy  is  convert ed  int o  another,  when  one  of  the  forms  is  heat .  The  st udy  of thermodynamics dat es from before the invent ion of the first pract ical st eam  engine-an engine that uses st eam to produce physical power-in the 18th cent ury. Today most of the world's  electrical  power  is  act ually  produced  by  st eam  engines, and  the  principal  use  of thermodynamics is in power product ion.
 
==========thermonuclear
           Of or relat ing to the changes in the nucleus of at oms with low at omic weight , such as hydrogen, thatrequire a very high t emperat ure to begin.


?
 In the 1950s and '60s, anxious American families built thousands of underground "fallout shelt ers" to prot ect themselves from the radiat ion of a thermonuclear blast .


Nuclear is the adject ive for nucleus, the main central part of an at om. The original nuclear explosives, det onat ed in 1945, were so-called fission bombs, since they relied on the fission, or split t ing, of the nuclei of uranium at oms. Butan even great er source of destruct ive power lay in nuclear fusion, the forcing t ogether of at omic nuclei. The lightand heat given off by stars such as the sun come from a sustained fusion-or thermonuclear-react ion deep within it . On earth, such thermonuclear react ions were used to develop the hydrogen bomb, a bomb based on a fusion react ion that merged hydrogen at oms to become helium at oms. The thermonuclear era, which began in 1952, produced bombs hundreds of t imes more powerful than those exploded at the end of World War I. Why the thermo- in thermonuclear?
 Because greatheat is required to trigger the fusion process, and the trigger used is act ually a fission bomb.
 
==========Brit ish thermal unit The quant it y of heatrequired to raise the t emperat ure of one pound of wat er one degree Fahrenheitata specified t emperat ure.


?
 Wood-st ove manufact urers compet e with each other in their claims of how many Brit ish thermal unit s of heat out put their st oves can produce.


Despit e it s name, the Brit ish thermal unit , or BTU, may be more widely used in North America than in Britain. Air condit ioners, furnaces, and st oves are generally rat ed by BTUs. (Though "BTUs" is oft en short for "BTUs per hour"; in air-condit ioner rat ings, for instance, "BTUs" really means "BTUs of cooling capacit y per hour.") Fuels such as nat ural gas and propane are also compared using BTUs. The BTU firstappeared in 1876 and isn't part of the metric syst em- the metric unit of energy is the much smaller joule-so it isn't much used by scient ist s, but it s pract icalit y keeps it popular for consumer goods and fuels. A bet t er-known heat unit is the calorie; a BTU is equal to about 252 calories. (Since the familiar food calorie is act ually a kilocalorie, a BTU equals only abouta quart er of a food calorie.)

==========POLY comes from polys, the Greek word for "many." A polytechnic inst it ut e offers instruct ion in many t echnical fields. Polygamy is marriage in which one has many spouses, or at least more than the legal limit of one. And polysyllabic words are words of many syllables-of which there are quit e a few in this book.
 
==========polyp                   (1) A sea invert ebrat e thathas a mouth opening at one end surrounded by st inging t entacles. (2) A growth project ing from a mucous membrane, as on the colon or vocal cords.


?
 She had had a polyp removed from her throat , and for two weeks aft erward she could only whisper.


This t erm comes from polypous, a Greek word for "oct opus," which meant lit erally "many- foot ed." To the untrained eye, the invert ebrat e known as the polyp may likewise appear to be many-foot ed, though it never walks anywhere since it s "feet " are t entacles, used for st inging t iny organisms which the polyp then devours. The t ypes of t umor known as polyps got their name because some seem to be at tached to the surface by branching "foot "-like root s, even though most do not . Polyps of the nose or vocal cords are usually only inconvenient , causing breathing difficult y or hoarseness, and can be removed easily; however, polyps in the int est ines can somet imes t urn cancerous.
 
==========polyglot                      (1) One who can speak or writ e several languages. (2) Having or using several languages.


?
 As trade bet ween countries increases, there is more need for polyglot s who can actas negot iat ors.


Polyglot contains the root glot, meaning "language." It is used both as a noun and as an adject ive. Thus, we could say thatan int ernat ional airport is bound to be polyglot, with people from all over the world speaking their nat ive languages. One of hist ory's more int erest ing polyglot s was the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who claimed thathe addressed his horse only in German, conversed with women in Italian and with men in French, butreserved Spanish (his original language) for his talks with God.
 
==========polymer              A chemical compound formed by a react ion in which two or more molecules combine to form larger molecules with repeat ing struct ural unit s.


?
 Nylon, a polymer commercially introduced in 1938, can be spun and woven int o fabrics or castas t ough, elast ic blocks.


There are many nat ural polymers,  including shellac, cellulose,  and rubber. But synthet ic polymers only came int o being around 1870 with Celluloid, known especially for it s use in phot ographic film. Aft er many decades of development , the polymeric compounds now include polypropylene, used in milk crat es, luggage, and hinges; polyurethane, used in paint s, adhesives, molded it ems, rubbers, and foams; and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), used to make pipes that won'trust . And let 's not forget polyester, which gave us a lot of uncool clothing in the 1970s but whose strength  and  resistance to corrosion  have  ensured  that  it  remains  an extremely useful mat erial for all kinds of goods.
 
==========polygraph                      An instrument  for recording changes in several bodily funct ions (such as blood pressure and rat e of breathing) at the same t ime; lie det ect or.


?
 My brother-in-law is complet ely law-abiding, buthe's such a nervous t ype thathe's failed two polygraph t est s at job int erviews.


With it s graph- root (see GRAPH) , polygraph  indicat es that it writ es out several differentresult s. A polygraph's out put consist s of a set of squiggly lines on a comput er screen, each indicat ing one funct ion being t est ed. The funct ions most commonly measured are blood pressure, breathing rat e, pulse, and perspirat ion, all of which t end to increase when you lie. Polygraphs have been in use since 1924, and have got t en more sensit ive over the years, though many expert s st ill believe that they're unreliable and thata prepared liar can fool the machine.

==========PRIM comes from primus, the Latin word for "first ." Something primary is first in t ime, rank, or importance. Something primitive is in it s first stage of development . And something primeval had it s origin in the first period of world or human hist ory.
 
==========primal                    Basic or primit ive.


?
 There was always a primal pleasure in list ening to the rain beat on the roof at nightand dropping off to sleep in front of the fire.


Primal generally describes something powerful and almost inst inct ual. So when we speak of the primal innocence of youth or the primal int ensit y of someone's devot ion, we're suggest ing that the emot ions or condit ions being described are basic to our animal nat ure. Sit t ing around a campfire may feel like a primal experience, in which we share the emot ions of our cave- dwelling ancest ors. Int ense fear of snakes or spiders may have primal root s, owing to the poison that some species carry. In "primal scream" therapy, popular in the 1970s, pat ient s relive painful childhood experiences and express their frustrat ion and anger through uncontrolled screaming and even violence.

Primers were once a standard part of every child's educat ion. The first primer print ed in North America, The New England Primer (ca. 1690), was t ypical; it contained many quotat ions from the Bible and many moral lessons, and the t ext was accompanied by numerous woodcut illustrat ions. We no longer use the word in early educat ion, but it 's widely used in everyday speech. Not ice how primer is pronounced; don't mix it up with the kind of paint that 's pronounced with a long i sound.
 
==========primat e                   Any member of the group of animals that includes human beings, apes, and monkeys.


?
 Dr. Leakey sent three young women to work with individual primat es: Jane Goodall with the chimpanzees, Dian Fossey with the gorillas, and Birut e Galdakis with the orangutans.


It was the great biologist Carolus Linnaeus who gave the primat es their name, to indicat e thatanimals of this order were the mostadvanced of all. Linnaeus list ed human beings with the apes a hundred years before Charles Darwin would publish his famous work on evolut ion. When people t old him that our close relat ionship to the apes and monkeys was impossible because it disagreed with the Bible, he responded that , from the biological evidence, he simply couldn't come to a different conclusion. Among the mammals, the primat es are dist inguished by their large brains, weak sense of smell, lack of claws, long pregnancies, and long childhoods, among other  things. Along  with  the  apes  and  monkey, the  Primat e  order  includes  such int erest ing animals as the lemurs, tarsiers, galagos, and lorises.

 Many astronomers think the universe is cont inuing to evolve from a primordial cloud of gas.


Primordial can be traced back to the Latin word primordium,  or  "origin,"  and  applies to something that is only the start ing point in a course of development or progression. A primordial landscape is one that bears no sign of human use, and a primordial cell is the first formed and least specialized in a line of cells. The substance out of which the earth was formed and from which all life evolved is commonly called "the primordial ooze" or "the primordial soup"-even by scient ist s.

==========HOM/HOMO comes from homos, the Greek word for "same," which in English words may also mean "similar." A homograph is a word spelled like another word but different in meaning or pronunciat ion, and a homosexual is a person who favors others of the same sex. (This roothas nothing to do with the Latin homo, meaning "person," as in Homo sapiens, the French homme, and the Spanish hombre.)
 
==========homonym                    One of two or more words pronounced and/or spelled alike but different in meaning.


?
 The pool of "a pool of wat er" and the pool of "a game of pool" are homonyms.


Homonym can be troublesome because it may refer to three dist inct classes of words. Homonyms may be words with ident ical pronunciat ions but different spellings and meanings, such as to, too, and two. Or they may be words with both ident ical pronunciat ions and ident ical spellings but different meanings, such as quail (the bird) and quail (t o cringe). Finally, they may be words thatare spelled alike butare different in pronunciat ion and meaning, such as the bow of a ship and bow that shoot s arrows. The firstand second t ypes are somet imes called homophones, and the second and third t ypes are somet imes called homographs-which makes naming the second t ype a bit confusing. Some language scholars prefer to limithomonym to the third t ype.
 
==========homogeneous
      (1)  Of  the  same  or  a  similar  kind. (2)  Of  uniform struct ure or composit ion throughout .


?
 Though she was raised in a small t own, she found the cit y more int erest ing because it s populat ion was less homogeneous.


A slab of rock is homogeneous if it consist s of the same mat erial throughout , like granit e or marble. A neighborhood might be called homogeneous if all the people in itare similar, having pret t y much the  same background, educat ion, and  out look. Homogeneity is fine in a rock, though some people find ita lit t le boring in a neighborhood (while others find it comfort ing). Not e that many people spell this word homogenous, and pronounce it that way t oo.
 
==========homologous                           Developing from the same or a similar part  of a remot e ancest or.


?
 Arms and wings are homologous struct ures thatreveal the ancientrelat ionship bet ween birds and four-legged animals.


In his famous discussion of the panda's thumb, St ephen Jay Gould carefully explains how this thumb is nothomologous to the human thumb. Although the two digit s are used in much the same way (the panda's thumb is essent ial for stripping bamboo of it s tast y leaves, the staple of the panda's diet ), the panda's thumb developed from a bone in it s wristand is an addit ion to the five "fingers" of it s paw. The t iny st irrup and anvil bones of our inner ear, however, do seem to be homologous with the bones thatallow a gart er snake to swallow a frog whole.
 
==========homogenize
    (1) To  treat  (milk) so  that  the  fat  is  mixed  throughout inst ead of float ing on t op. (2) To change (something) so that it s part s are the same or similar.


?
 By now the suburb had got t en so homogenized thathe couldn't t ell the families on his streetapart .


Homogenized milk has been around so long-abouta hundred years-that many Americans have never seen milk with the cream on t op, and probably think cream separat ion  only happens in expensive yogurt . Buthomogenize was being used before anyone succeeded in get t ing milk and cream to mix. People who use the word oft en dislike the idea that everything is becoming the same, whether it 's radio shows thatare no longer produced locally or schools thatrely t oo much on standardized t est ing.
 
==========DIS comes from Latin, where it means "apart ." In English, it s meanings have increased to include "opposit e" or "not " (as in distaste, disagreeable), "deprive of" (disinfect), or "exclude or expel from" (disbar). The original meaning can st ill be seen in a word like dissipate, which means "t o break up and scat t er."
 
==========dissuade                       To convince (someone) not to do something.


?
 The thought of the danger he might be facing on the journey makes her uneasy, and she's trying to dissuade him from going.


Dissuade is the opposit e of persuade, though it 's a less common word. The dissuading may be done by a person or by something else: A bad weather forecast may dissuade a fisherman from going out to sea that day, buta warning on a cigaret t e pack almost never dissuades a real smoker from having his or her next cigaret t e.
 
==========disorient
    To cause to be confused or lost .


?
 By now the hikers were complet ely disorient ed, and darkness was falling fast .


The Orient  is the East  (just  as the Occident  is the West ). The verb orient comes from the tradit ional pract ice of building Christ ian churches so that the altar is at the building's east erly end-in other words, "orient ing" the church. One reason for this pract ice is that the Book of Mat thew says, "As the light ning comes from the East . . . so also will the Son of Man"-that is, just like the sun in the morning, Jesus in his Second Coming will appear in the East . Orienteering is part icipat ing in a cross-country race in which each person uses a map and compass to navigat e the course. Orient comes from the word meaning "t o rise" (like the sun), and st ill t oday it 's easy for a hiker to become disorient ed when an overcast sky hides the sun.
 
==========discredit
  (1) To cause (someone or something) to seem dishonest or untrue.
(2) To damage the reputat ion of (someone).


?
 His book had been thoroughly discredit ed by scholars,  and his reputat ion was badly damaged.


Since one meaning of credit is "trust ," discredit means basically  "destroy  one's  trust ."  A scient ific st udy may be discredit ed if it t urns out it was secret ly writ t en up by someone paid by a drug company. An aut obiography may be discredit ed if someone discovers that the best part s came out of a novel. A lawyer may try to discredit t est imony in a trial by revealing that  the wit ness just got out of the slammer. Many polit ical campaigns rely on discredit ing one's opponent s; desperat e polit icians have learned that , if they can claim that someone at tacking them has been complet ely discredit ed, it might work even if it isn't true.
 
==========dislodge                  To force out of a place, especially a place of rest , hiding, or defense.


?
 Senat ors are at t empt ing to dislodge the bill from the commit t ee, where the chairman has failed to act on it for five months.


A lodge is usually a kind of roominghouse or hot el, and the verb lodge oft en means staying or sleeping in such a place. Thus, dislodge means removing a person or thing from where it 's been staying. So, for instance, you might use a t oothpick to dislodge a seed from bet ween your t eeth, police might use t ear gas to dislodge a sniper from his hiding place, and a slat e t ile dislodged from a roof could be dangerous to someone hanging out on the street below.

Ad hoc lit erally means "for this" in Latin, and in English this almostalways means "for this specific purpose." Issues that come up in the course of a project oft en require immediat e, ad hoc solut ions. An ad hoc invest igat ing commit t ee is authorized to look int o a mat t er of limit ed scope.

Ad hominem in Latin means "t o the man"-that is, "against the other person." The t erm comes from the field of rhet oric (the art of speaking and writ ing). If you have a weak argument , one easy way to defend yourself has always been to at tack your opponent verbally in a personal way. Since such at tacks require neither truth nor logic to be effect ive, their popularit y has never waned.
 
==========alt er ego                          (1) A trust ed friend or personal representat ive. (2) The opposit e side of a personalit y.


?
 The Whit e House chief of staff is a polit ical alt er ego, who knows, or should know, who and what the President considers most important .


In Latin, alter ego lit erally means "second I." An alt er ego can be thought of as a person's clone or second self. A professional alt er ego might be a trust ed aide who knows exact ly what the boss want s done. A personal alt er ego might be a close friend who is almost like a t win. Alter ego can also refer to the second, hidden side of one's own self. In Robert Louis St evenson's classic The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll is a good-heart ed, honorable man; butaft er taking a pot ion, his alt er ego, the loathsome and diabolical Mr. Hyde, takes over his personalit y.
 
==========de fact o                        Being such in pract ice or effect , although not  formally recognized; act ual.


?
 Although there was never a general declarat ion of war, the two countries were at war in a de fact o sense for almosta decade.


Lit erally meaning "from the fact ," de facto in English can be applied to anything thathas the substance of something without it s formal name. A de fact o government is one that operat es with all of the power of a regular government but without official recognit ion. De  fact o segregat ion isn't the result of laws, but can be justas real and deep-root ed as legally enforced segregat ion. The de fact o leader of a group is just the one who all the rest seem to follow. (Compare de jure.)
 
==========quid pro quo
  Something given or received for something else.


?
 He did something very nice for me years ago, so get t ing him that job was really a quid pro quo.


In Latin, quid pro quo means lit erally "something for something." Originally, the phrase was used to mean the subst it ut ion of an inferior medicine for a good one. Today it oft en doesn't suggestanything negat ive; for most people, it just means "a favor for a favor." But in polit ics the phrase is oft en used when, for example, a wealthy corporat ion gives a lot of money to a candidat e and expect s to geta big favor in ret urn. In such cases, some of us may prefer to describe the money as a bribe and the quid pro quo as a payoff.
 
==========ex post fact o
      Done, made, or formulat ed aft er the fact .


?
 When Carl t ells us his "reasons" for why he behaved badly, they're nothing but ex post fact o excuses for impulsive behavior.


Ex post facto is Latin for "from a thing done aft erward." Approval for a project that 's given ex post fact o-aft er the projectalready has been begun or complet ed-may justhave been given in order to save face. An ex post fact o law is one that declares someone's act ion to be criminal only aft er it was commit t ed-a procedure forbidden by our Const it ut ion.
 
==========modus operandi
                A usual way of doing something.


?
 A criminal who commit s repeat ed crimes can oft en be ident ified by his modus operandi.


Modus operandi is Latin for "method of operat ing." The t erm is oft en associat ed with police work, and it 's a favorit e of myst ery writ ers. In speech and dialogue, it 's oft en abbreviat ed to "m.o." (as in "We're beginning to geta handle on the killer's m.o., but we can't go public with it yet "). But it 's not only used in criminal cont ext s. So a frequent gambler who likes to play the horses may have a part icular modus operandi for picking winners. And the familiar modus operandi of a cut throatretailer may be to undersell compet it ors, drive them out of business, and then raise prices aft erwards.
 
==========modus vivendi
  (1) A pract ical compromise or arrangement that is acceptable to all concerned. (2) A way of life.


?
 During the budget crisis, the Democrat ic governor and the Republican legislat ure established a good working modus vivendi.


Modus vivendi lit erally means "manner of living" in Latin, and it somet imes has that meaning in English as well. Usually, though, a modus vivendi is a working arrangement that disput ing part ies can live with, at least unt il a more permanent solut ion can be found. Typically, a modus vivendi is an arrangement that ignores differences and difficult ies. So, for example, two people going through a bit t er divorce may be able to arrive ata modus vivendi thatallows them to at least maintain an appearance of civilit y and dignit y.

VOR CARN CRED FID CURR/CURS PED FLECT POST WordsfromMythology
Quiz4-1 Quiz4-2 Quiz4-3 Quiz4-4 Quiz4-5 ReviewQuizzes4

VOR comes from the Latin verb vorare, "t o eat ," and the ending -ivorous shows up in words thatrefer to eat ers of certain kinds of food. Frugivorous (for "fruit -eat ing"), granivorous (for "grain-eat ing"), and graminivorous (for "grass-eat ing") aren't t oo rare, but you won'trun across phytosuccivorous ("plant -sap-eat ing") every day.
 
==========carnivorous
      Meat -eat ing or flesh-eat ing.


?
 He'd got t en t ired of his vegetarian guinea pigs and decided he preferred carnivorous pet s such as ferret s.


The order of mammals that Linnaeus named the Carnivora includes such families as the dogs, the bears, the raccoons, the weasels, the hyenas, the cat s, and the seals. Most carnivores eat only meat in the wild, but some have varied diet s; some bears, for instance, normally eat far more vegetat ion than meat . Carnivores have powerful jaws and complex t eeth, and mostare highly int elligent . Humans, like their ape cousins, are basically omnivores (see omnivore).
 
==========herbivorous
      Plant -eat ing.


?
 In spit e of their fright ening appearance, marine iguanas are peaceable herbivorous animals that feed most ly on seaweed.


Many herbivorous animals, such as rabbit s, deer, sheep, and cows, are not ed for their gent le and passive ways. But such behavior is not universal among herbivores. Rhinoceroses and elephant s, for instance, are capable of inflict ing serious damage if threat ened, and among dinosaurs, the herbivorous Diplodocus had a thick tail that could be used as a lethal weapon againstat tacking carnivores. Herbivorous humans are usually called vegetarians.
 
==========insect ivorous
 Feeding on insect s.


?
 Their rather odd 12-year-old son kept insect ivorous plant s in his bedroom and fed them live flies.


A wide variet y of animals could be called insectivores-most of the birds, for example, as well as the spiders. Of the amphibians, frogs and many lizards are largely insect ivorous. Even some fish get much of their food from insect s. The order of mammals called Insect ivora contains the shrews, moles, and hedgehogs, though bat s and ant eat ers are also insect ivores. Many insect s are themselves insect ivores; the dragonfly, for instance, is a swift insect ivorous t error that lives up to it s name. But it 's the insect ivorous plant s that t end to fascinat e us; of the over 600 species, the best known are the Venus flytrap (which snaps shut on it s prey), the pit cher plant s (which drown insect s in a t iny pool of wat er), and the sundews (which capt ure insect s with their st icky surfaces).
 
==========voracious
 Having a huge appet it e.


?
 One of the hardest part s of diet ing is wat ching skinny people with voracious appet it es consume large amount s of food without gaining weight .


Voracious can be applied to people, animals, and even things, and doesn'talways refer to consuming food. Thus, t eenagers are voracious eat ers; you may become a voracious reader on vacat ion; and Americans have long been voracious consumers. The most voracious bat s may eat three-quart ers of their weight in insect s in a single night . Some countries have a voracious appet it e for oil. Voracious corporat ions keep "swallowing" other companies through mergers.
 
==========CARN comes from a Latin word meaning "flesh" or "meat ." Carnation originally meant "the color of flesh," which was once the only color of the flower we call the carnat ion. In Christ ian countries, Lent is the period when the faithful tradit ionally give up something they love, oft en meat . The days leading up to Lentare known as the carnival season, from the Italian carnelevare, lat er short ened to carnevale, which meant "removal of meat "-though during carnival, of course, people indulge in justabout everything, and the removal of  meat only comes lat er.
 
==========carnage                   Great destruct ion of life (as in a bat t le); slaught er.


?
 Countries around the world appealed to all sides of the conflict to st op the carnage of the war in Bosnia.


This word was taken over straight from French (a Latin-based language), and has most ly referred to large-scale killing in wart ime. But carnage needn'trefer only to slaught er on the bat t lefield. With t ens of thousands of people dying each year in aut omobile accident s, it 's appropriat e to speak of carnage on the nat ion's highways. And those concerned about the effect s of the violence we see constant ly on TV and movie screens may refer to thatas carnage as well.
 
==========carnal                     Having to do with bodily pleasures.


?
 The news st ories about st udent s on Spring Break t end to focus on the carnal pleasures associat ed with the annual rit ual.


In Christ ianit y in past cent uries, carnal was oft en used as the opposit e of spiritual, describing whatare somet imes called "the pleasures of the flesh." Thus, glut t ony-the consumpt ion of excessive food and drink-was a deadly carnal sin, whereas the holiest  monks and hermit s might eathardly anything and never t ouch wine. Today carnal has a somewhat old-fashioned sound; when we use it , we generally mean simply "sexual."
 
==========incarnat e
Given bodily or act ual form; especially, having human body.


?
 For the rest of his life, he would regard his childhood nanny as goodness incarnat e.


Incarnate oft en has a religious ring to it , since for cent uries ithas been used in the Christ ian church, which regards Jesus as the incarnation of God-that is, as God made human. Surprisingly, neither word appears in Bible translat ions; inst ead, the Latin word incarnatus appears in the Christ ian creeds (basic stat ement s of belief) and the Catholic Mass. Regardless, incarnate soon began to be used with various nouns: "the devil incarnat e," "evil incarnat e," et c. Not ice that incarnate is one of the rare adject ives that usually, but notalways, follows it s noun. Incarnate is also a verb, though with a slight ly different pronunciat ion: "This report simply incarnat es the prejudices of it s authors," "For her followers, she incarnat es the virt ue of selflessness," et c.
 
==========reincarnat ion
(1)  Rebirth  in  new  bodies  or  forms  of  life. (2) Someone who has been born again with a new body aft er death.


?
 Even as a child he struck everyone as a reincarnat ion of his grandfather, not in his feat ures but in his manner and personalit y.


It 's easy to make fun of people who claim to be the reincarnat ion of Cleopatra or Napoleon, but they don't come from a cult ure that takes reincarnat ion seriously. In Hindu belief, a person must pass through a series of reincarnat ions-some of which may be as insect s or fish- before fully realizing that the bodily pleasures are shallow and that only spirit ual life is truly valuable; only then do the reincarnat ions cease. For Hindus, an "old soul" is a person who seems unusually wise from early in life, and whose wisdom must  have come from passing through many reincarnat ions.

==========CRED comes from credere, the Latin verb meaning "t o believe" or "t o entrust ." We have a good creditrat ing when inst it ut ions trust in our abilit y to repay a loan, and we carry credentials so that others will believe that we are who we say we are.
 
==========credence                         Mental acceptance of something as true or real; belief.


?
 He scoffed and said no one st ill gives any credence to the st ory of the Loch Ness monst er.


Credence is close in meaning to belief, but there are differences. Unlike belief, credence is seldom used in connect ion with faith in a religion or philosophy. Inst ead credence is oft en used in reference to report s, rumors, and opinions. And, unlike belief, it t ends to be used with the words give, lack, lend,and gain. So a new piece of evidence may lend credence to the alibi of a criminal suspect . Claims thata polit ical candidat e can become the next President gain credence only aft er the candidat e wins a few primaries. And although st ories about Elvis sight ings persist , they lack credence for most people.
 
==========credible                    (1) Able to be believed; reasonable to trust  or believe. (2) Good enough to be effect ive.


?
 Because of her past criminal record, the defense lawyers knew she wouldn't be a credible wit ness.


Credible evidence is evidence that 's likely to be believed. A credible plan is one that mightact ually work, and a credible excuse is one your parent s mightact ually believe. And justas credible means "believable," the noun credibility means "believabilit y." (But we no longer use incredible to mean the lit eral opposit e of credible, justas we no longer use unbelievable as the lit eral opposit e of believable.) Since cred is short for credibility, "street cred" is the kind of credibilit y among t ough young people that you can only get by proving yourself on the mean street s of the inner cit y.
 
==========credulit y
 Readiness and willingness to believe on the basis of lit t le evidence.


?
 Thrillers and act ion movies only succeed if they don't strain our credulit y t oo much.


A part icularly far-fet ched st ory may be said to strain credulit y, stret ch credulit y, put demands on our credulit y, or make claims on our credulit y. Credulit y is a qualit y of innocent children (of all ages) and isn'talways a bad thing; it musthave been pure credulit y that enabled Chicago Whit e Sox and Philadelphia Phillies fans to wait so long for a World Series vict ory ("This is the year they're going to take it !"), which probably made life bearable  for them. The  relat ed adject ive is credulous. F. Scot t Fit zgerald once defined advert ising as "making dubious promises to a credulous public."
 
==========credo         (1) A stat ement of the basic beliefs of a religious faith. (2) A set of guiding principles or beliefs.


?
 She claims she made her money on Wall Street just by following the old credo "Buy low, sell high."


Credo comes straight from the Latin word meaning "I believe," and is the first word of many religious credos, or creeds, such as the Apost les' Creed and the Nicene Creed. But the word can be applied to any guiding principle or set of principles. Of course, you may choose a different credo when you're 52 than when you're 19. Buthere is the credo of the writ er H. L. Mencken, writ t en aft er he had lived quit e a few years: "I believe that it is bet t er to t ell the truth than to lie. I believe that it is bet t er to be free than to be a slave. And I believe that it is bet t er to know than to be ignorant ."
 
==========FID comes from fides, the Latin  word  for  "faith"  or  "trust ." Fidelity  is  another  word  for "faithfulness." Confidence is having faith in someone or something. An infidel is someone who lacks a part icular kind of religious faith. And the once-popular dog's name Fido is Latin for "I trust ."
 
==========affidavit
   A sworn stat ement made in writ ing.


?
 The whole family had signed affidavit s stat ing that they believed the will to be valid.


In Latin, affidavit means "he (she) has sworn an oath," and an affidavit is always a sworn writ t en document . If it contains a lie, the person making it may be prosecut ed. Affidavit s are oft en used in court when it isn't possible for someone to appear in person. Police officers must usually file an affidavit with a judge to geta search warrant . Affidavit s (unlike similar signed stat ement s called depositions) are usually made withoutan opposing lawyer being presentand able to ask quest ions.
 
==========diffident                           Lacking confidence; t imid, caut ious.


?
 He always found ita struggle to gethis most diffident st udent s to speak in front of the class.


Diffident means lacking faith in oneself-in other words, the opposit e of confident. Distrust in your abilit ies or opinions usually makes you hesitat e to speak or act . Pat ient s who feel diffidentaround their doct ors, for example, don't dare ask them many quest ions. A helpful friend tries to inst ill confidence in place of diffidence.
 
==========fiduciary
   (1) Having to do with a confidence or trust . (2) Held in trust for another.


?
 Pension-fund managers have a fiduciary responsibilit y to invest the pension's funds for the sole benefit of those who will receive the pensions.


A fiduciary relat ionship is one in which one person places faith in another. St ockbrokers and real-estat e agent s have fiduciary dut ies to their client s, which means they mustact in their client s' best financial int erest s. Members of a company's board of direct ors have a fiduciary responsibilit y to prot ect the financial int erest s of the company's shareholders. There are legal requirement s for those with fiduciary responsibilit y, and they can be sued for breach  of fiduciary dut y if they fail.
 
==========perfidy                          Faithlessness, disloyalt y, or treachery.


?

==========CURR/CURS comes from currere, the Latin verb meaning "t o run." Although words based on this root don't t end to suggest speed, the sense of movementremains. Current, for instance, refers to running  wat er in a  stream or river, or electrons running  through a  wire, and an excursion is a trip from one place to another.
 
==========concurrent
   Happening or operat ing at the same t ime.


?
 The killer was sent enced to serve three concurrent life t erms in prison.


Things thatare concurrent usually not only happen at the same t ime butalso are similar to each  other. So, for example, mult itasking  comput ers are  capable  of  performing  concurrent tasks. When we take more than one medicat ion ata t ime, we run the risks involved with concurrent drug use. And atany mult iplex theat er several movies are running concurrently.
 
==========cursory                          Hast ily and oft en carelessly done.


?
 Having spent the weekend going to part ies, she had only given the chapt er a cursory reading before class on Monday.


Unlike the other words in this sect ion, cursory always implies speed. But italso stresses a lack of at t ent ion to detail. Cursory observat ions are generally shallow or superficial because of their speed. And when cit izens complain abouta cursory police invest igat ion of a crime, they're distressed by it s lack of thoroughness, not it s speed.
 
==========discursive
Passing from one t opic to another.


?
 Some days he allowed himself to writ e long discursive essays in his diary inst ead of his usual simple report ing of the day's event s.


The Latin verb discurrere meant "t o run about ," and from this word we get our word discursive, which oft en means rambling about over a wide range of  t opics. A discursive writ ing st yle generally isn't encouraged by writ ing t eachers. But some of the great 19th-cent ury writ ers, such as Charles Lamb and Thomas de Quincey, show that the discursive essay, especially when gracefully writ t en and somewhat personal in t one, can be a pleasure to read. And the man oft en called the invent or of the essay, the great Michel de Montaigne, might t ouch on dozens of different t opics in the course of a long discursive essay.
 
==========precursor
    One that goes before and indicat es the coming of another.


?
 Scient ist s are trying to ident ify special geological act ivit y that may be a precursor to an earthquake, which will help them predict the quake's size, t ime, and locat ion.


With it s prefix pre-, meaning "before," a precursor is lit erally a "forerunner," and in fact forerunner firstappeared as the translat ion of the Latin praecursor. But the two words funct ion a lit t le different ly t oday. A forerunner may simply come before another thing, buta precursor generally paves the way for something. So, for example, the Office of Strat egic Services in World War I was the immediat e precursor of t oday's Central Int elligence Agency, while the blues music of the 1930s and 1940s was only one of the precursors of the rock and roll of t oday.
 
==========PED comes from the Latin word for "foot ." A pedal is pushed by the foot ; a pedicure is a treat ment of the feet , t oes, and t oenails; and a pedestal is whata stat ue stands on-in a sense, it s foot .
 
==========quadruped
      An animal having four feet .


?
 She always t ells her friends that their farm has five kinds of quadrupeds: sheep, goat s, cows, horses, and pigs.


The quadrupeds include almostall the mammals. (Among the except ions are whales, bat s, and humans.) The Greek equivalent of this  Latin  word  is tetrapod. However, the  two are  not ident ical, since the t etrapod classificat ion includes bipeds such as birds, in which two of the limbs are no longer used for walking. Insect s all have six legs, of course, and in the sea there are eight -legged octopods (including the oct opus). But there are no animals of any kind with an odd number of legs.
 
==========pedigree
The line of ancest ors of a person or animal.


?
 She talks a lotabouther pedigree, but never ment ions thata couple of her uncles spent t ime in prison.


What does someone's ancestry have to do with feet ?
 Because someone once thought thata family tree, or genealogical chart , resembled a crane's foot  (in French, pied de grue), even though cranes' feet only have four talons or claws, no more than any other bird, while a family tree may have hundreds of branches. The word pedigree is usually used for purebred animals
-cat s, racehorses, and dogs, as well as livest ock such as cows and sheep. Some people cont inue to believe that "purit y" in human family trees is a good thing as well, though most of us find the idea a lit t le creepy.
 
==========impediment
    Something that int erferes with movement or progress.


?
 Her poorly developed verbal abilit y was the most serious impediment to her advancement .


Impediment comes from a Latin verb that meant "t o int erfere with" or "t o get in the way of progress," as if by tripping up the feet of someone walking. In English, impediment st ill suggest s an obstruct ion or obstacle along a path; for example, a lack of adequat e roads and bridges would be called an impediment to economic development . Impediment s usually get in the way of something we want . So we may speak of an impediment to communicat ion, marriage, or progress-but something that slows the progress of aging, disease, or decay is rarely called an impediment .
 
==========pedestrian
 Commonplace, ordinary, or unimaginat ive.


?
 While polit icians endlessly discussed the great issues facing Russia, the Russians worried about such pedestrian concerns as finding enough food, shelt er, and clothing.


Most of us know pedestrian as a noun meaning someone  who  travels  on  foot . But  the adject ive sense of pedestrian as defined here is act ually it s original meaning. To be pedestrian was to be drab or dull, as if plodding along on footrather than speeding on horseback or by coach. Pedestrian is oft en used to describe a colorless or lifeless writ ing st yle, but it can also describe polit icians, public tast es, personal qualit ies, or possessions. In comparison with the elaborat e stage shows put on by t oday's rock art ist s, for instance, most of  the  stage presentat ions of 1960s rock stars seem pedestrian.

==========FLECT comes from flectere, the Latin verb meaning "t o bend." The root somet imes takes the form flex-. Things thatare flexible can be bent , and when you flex a muscle, you're usually bending a limb-which, as a trainer at the gym will t ell you, requires the use of flexor muscles.
 
==========deflect                     To t urn aside, especially from a straight or fixed course.


?
 The st ealth t echnology used on bombers and fight er jet s works by deflect ing radar energy, making them "invisible."


Use of the physical meaning of deflect is common. Thus, a soccer goalie's save might involve deflect ing the ball rather than cat ching it , and workers wear eye shields to deflect t iny part icles flying out of machines. But the nonphysical meaning may be even more common. A Hollywood actress might deflect crit icism abouther personal life by giving lavishly to charit y, for example, and we've all tried to change the subject to deflecta quest ion we really didn't want to answer.
 
==========reflect ive                   (1) Capable of reflect ing light , images, or sound waves. (2) Thought ful.


?
 He likes act ion movies and going out drinking with friends, but when you get to know him you realize he's basically reflect ive and serious.


Reflect ive people are people who reflect on things-that is, look back at things thathave been done or said in order to think calmly and quiet ly about them. Mostreflect ive people would agree with Socrat es that (as he t old the jury that would soon sent ence him to death) "The unexamined life is  not  worth  living."  Reflect ive  people  t end to be  a  bit  philosophical and int ellect ual. Butalmost everyone has reflect ive moods; gazing int o a fireplace or a campfire seems to do it to almost everyone.
 
==========genuflect
   To kneel on one knee and then rise as an act of respect .


?
 Atreligious shrines in China, pilgrims may not only genuflect butact ually lie down flat on the ground.


Genuflection, which contains the root genu-, "knee," has long been a mark of respectand obedience. King Arthur's Knight s of the Round Table genuflect ed not only when he knight ed  them but whenever they greet ed him formally, and this cust om remains in countries t oday thatare st ill ruled by royalt y. In some churches, each worshipper is expect ed to genuflect whenever ent ering or leaving a pew on the central aisle.
 
==========inflect ion                      (1) A change in the pit ch, t one, or loudness of the voice. (2) The change in form of a word showing it s case, gender, number, person, t ense, mood, voice, or comparison.


?
 She couldn't understand her grandfather's words, but she knew from his inflect ion thathe was asking a quest ion.


Changing the pit ch, t one, or loudness of our words are ways we communicat e meaning in speech, though not on the print ed page. A rising inflect ion at the end of a sent ence generally indicat es a quest ion, and a falling inflect ion indicat es a stat ement , for example. Another way of inflecting words is by adding endings: -s to make a noun plural, -ed to puta verb in the past t ense, -er to form the comparat ive form of an adject ive, and so on.
 
==========POST comes from a Latin word meaning "aft er" or "behind." A postscript (or PS) is a not e that comes aft er an otherwise complet ed let t er, usually as an aft erthought . Postpartum refers to the period following childbirth, with any relat ed event s and complicat ions. To postdate a check is to give ita dat e aft er the day it was writ t en.
 
==========post erior
  Sit uat ed t oward or on the back; rear.


?
 In a human posterior and dorsal can both refer to the back, but in a fish posterior refers to the tail area.


Posterior comes from the Latin word posterus, meaning "coming aft er." Posterior is oft en used as a t echnical t erm in biology and medicine to refer to the back side of things, and is the opposit e of anterior, which refers to the front side. For example, as more people t ook up running as a sport , doct ors began to see an increase in stress fract ures along the post erior as well as the ant erior surface of the lower leg bones. In some t echnical fields, posterior may mean "lat er." When used as a noun, posterior simply means "but t ocks."
 
==========posthumous                    (1) Published aft er the death of the author. (2) Following or happening aft er one's death.


?
 Though Van Gogh scarcely sold a single paint ing during his lifet ime, he rose to posthumous fame as one of the world's greatart ist s.


Posthumous fame is fame that comes a lit t le lat e. In fact , it s original meaning in English is "born aft er the death of the father." Bill Clint on was the posthumous son of a father who died in an aut omobile accident . The word is now most ly used of art ist ic works thatappear aft er the death of the art ist , or the changing reputat ion of a dead art ist . Such posthumous works as Herman Melville's Billy Budd, the diary of Anne Frank, and almostall the poetry of Emily Dickinson have become legendary, and in each case they had a major influence on the writ er's reputat ion.
 
==========post modern
  Having to do  with  a  movement  in  archit ect ure, art , or lit erat ure that is a react ion against modernism and thatreintroduces tradit ional element s and t echniques in odd cont ext s as well as element s from popular cult ure.


?
 The post modern AT& T building in New York, with the "Chippendale" t op thatreminds viewers of an ant ique dresser, aroused a st orm of crit icism.


With it s prefix post -, postmodern describes a movement thathas react ed against modernism. Modernism, dat ing from around the start of the 20th cent ury, represent ed a sharp break from 19th-cent ury st yles. But in the 1970s archit ect s began to be dissat isfied with  the  stark simplicit y of most modern archit ect ure and began including in their most ly modern designs such tradit ional element s as columns, arches, and keyst ones and somet imes start ling color contrast s such as mighthave come from advert ising and pop cult ure. In artand lit erat ure, as in archit ect ure, postmodernism oft en seems to be making fun of tradit ion, especially by denying that there's any real dist inct ion bet ween serious and popular art or writ ing. Wherever ithas shown up, post modernism has been  greet ed with  a mixt ure of approval, disapproval, and somet imes amusement .
 
==========post mort em
  (1) Occurring aft er death. (2) Following the event .


?
 In their post mort em discussion of the elect ion, the report ers tried to explain how the polls and predict ions could have been so complet ely wrong.


Post mortem is Latin for "aft er death." In  English, postmortem  refers to an  examinat ion, invest igat ion, or process that takes place aft er death. A post mort em examinat ion of a body (oft en simply called a postmortem) is oft en needed to det ermine the t ime and cause of death; the st iffening called rigor mort is is one post mort em change that doct ors look at to det ermine when death occurred. Today we've come to use postmortem to refer to any examinat ion or discussion that takes place aft er an event .

==========Words from Mythology

calypso                     A folk song or st yle of singing of West Indian origin thathas a lively rhythm and words thatare oft en made up by the singer.


?
 If you take a Caribbean vacat ion in December, you end up list ening to a lot of Christ mas carols played to a calypso beat .


In Homer's Odyssey, the nymph Calypso detains Odysseus for seven years on his way home from the Trojan War, using all her wiles to hold him on her lush island. For many people, the calypso music of the West Indian islands, which was event ually brought to America by singers such as the Andrews Sist ers and lat er Harry Belafont e, has some of the same capt ivat ing power as the nymph, though the lyrics thatare oft en improvised to the melodies t end to make fun of local people and happenings. The original name for these songs, however, act ually seems to be based on a similar-sounding African word, for which, early in the 20th cent ury, someone began subst it ut ing this name from Greek mythology.
 
==========odyssey             (1) A long, wandering journey full of trials and advent ures. (2) A spirit ual journey or quest .


?
 Their six-month camping trip around the country was an odyssey they would always remember.


Odysseus, the hero of Homer's Odyssey, spends 20 years traveling home from the Trojan War. He has ast onishing advent ures and learns a great deal abouthimself and the world; he even descends to the underworld to talk to the dead. Thus, an odyssey is any long, complicat ed journey, oft en a quest for a goal, and may be a spirit ual or psychological journey as well as an act ual voyage.
 
==========palladium                          A precious, silver-whit e metal relat ed to plat inum that is used in electrical contact s and as an alloy with gold to form whit e gold.


?
 Most wedding rings t oday are simple bands of gold, plat inum, or palladium.


Pallas Athena was one of the poet ical names given to the Greek goddess Athena (although it 's no longer clear what Pallas was supposed to mean), and the original palladium was a stat ue of Athena that was believed to have the power to prot ect the ancient cit y of Troy. When an ast eroid belt was discovered bet ween Mars and Jupit er, most of the ast eroids were named aft er figures in Greek mythology, and one of the first to be discovered was named Pallas in 1803. In the same year, scient ist s isolat ed a new silvery metal element , which they named palladium in honor of the recent ly discovered ast eroid.
 
==========Penelope
   A modest domest ic wife.


?
 Crit ics of Hillary Rodham Clint on in the 1990s would perhaps have preferred her to be a Penelope, quiet ly t ending the Whit e House and staying out of polit ics.


In the Odyssey, Penelope wait s 20 long years for her husband Odysseus to ret urn from Troy. During that t ime, she mustraise their son and fend off the at t ent ions of numerous rough suit ors. She preserves herself for a long t ime by saying she cannotremarry unt il she has finished weaving a funeral shroud for her aging father-in-law; however, what she weaves each day she secret ly unravels each night . A Penelope thus appears to be the perfect , pat ient , faithful wife (and may be using her clever int elligence to keep herself that way).
 
==========procrust ean                           Ruthlessly disregarding individual differences or special circumstances.


?
 The school's procrust ean approach seemed to assume thatall children learned in the same way and at the same rat e.


In the Greek tale of the hero Theseus, Procrust es was a bandit who ambushed travelers and, aft er robbing them, made them lie on an iron bed. To make sure they "fit " this bed, he would cut off the part s thathung off the ends or stret ch the body if it was t oo short ; either way, the unlucky traveler always died. When he made the mistake of confront ing Theseus, Procrust es was made to "fit " his own bed. Something procrust ean takes no account of individual differences but cruelly and mercilessly makes everything the same.
 
==========prot ean                (1) Displaying great  versat ilit y or variet y. (2) Able to take on many different forms or nat ures.


?
 A prot ean athlet e, he left college with offers from the professional leagues to play baseball, foot ball, and basket ball.


As the st ory is t old in the Odyssey, at the end of the Trojan War the sea god Prot eus revealed to King Menelaus of Sparta how to gethome from Troy with his unfaithful wife, the beaut iful Helen of Troy. Before Prot eus would give up the informat ion, though, Menelaus had to capt ure him-no mean feat , since Prot eus had the abilit y to change int o any nat ural shape he chose. The word protean came to describe this abilit y to change int o many different shapes or to play many differentroles in quick succession.
 
==========sibyl                 A female prophet or fort une-t eller.


?
 The villagers t old him aboutan aged woman who lived alone in a hut on a nearby mountain, a sibyl who knew the fut ure and would prophesy under the right condit ions.


Ancient writ ers refer to the exist ence of various women in such countries as  Babylonia, Greece, Italy, and Egypt , through whom the gods regularly spoke. These sibyls were easy to confuse with the oracles, women who were likewise mouthpieces of the gods, at such sit es as Apollo's t emple at Delphi. The most famous sibyl was the Sibyl of Cumae in Italy, a withered crone who lived in a cave. Her prophecies were collect ed int o t welve books, three of which survived to be consult ed by the Romans in t imes of nat ional emergencies. She is one of the five sibyls memorably depict ed by Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sist ine Chapel.
 
==========siren                  A woman who t empt s men with bewit ching sweet ness.


?
 Report ers treat ed her like a sex symbol, but she lacked the graceful presence and air of myst ery of a real siren.


The sirens were a group of part ly human female creat ures that lured sailors ont o destruct ive rocks with their singing. Odysseus and his men encount ered the sirens on their long journey home from Troy. The only way to sail by them safely was to make oneself deaf to their enchant ing song, so Odysseus packed the men's ears with wax, while he himself, ever curious, kepthis ears open buthad himself t ied to the mast to keep from flinging himself int o the wat er or st eering his ship t oward sure destruct ion in his desire to see them. A siren t oday is a sinist er butalmost irresist ible woman. A siren song, however, may be any appeal that lures a person to actagainsthis or her bet t er judgment .

MAL CATA PROT/PROTO ANTE ORTHO RECT EU DYS LatinBorrowings
Quiz5-1 Quiz5-2 Quiz5-3 Quiz5-4 Quiz5-5 ReviewQuizzes5

MAL comes from a Latin word meaning "bad." A malady is a bad condit ion-a disease or illness
-of the body or mind. Malpractice is bad medical pract ice. Malodorous things smell bad. And a
malefactor is someone guilt y of bad deeds.
 
==========malevolent
Having or showing int ense ill will or hatred.


?
 Captain Ahab sees Moby Dick not simply as a whale butas a powerfully malevolent foe.


Malevolence runs deep. Malevolent enemies have bit t er and last ing feelings of ill will. Malevolentracism and bigotry can erupt in act s of violence against innocent people. Malevolence can also show it self in hurt ful words, and can somet imes be seen in something as small as an angry look or gest ure.
 
==========malicious
 Desiring to cause pain, injury, or distress to another.


?
 The boys didn't take the apples with any malicious int ent ; they were justhungry and didn't know any bet t er.


Malicious and malevolentare close in meaning, since both refer to ill will that desires to see someone else suffer. But while malevolent suggest s deep and last ing dislike, malicious usually means pet t y and spit eful. Malicious gossipers are oft en simply envious of a neighbor's good fort une. Vandals may take malicious pleasure in destroying and defacing propert y but usually don't truly hat e the owners. Malice is an important legal concept , which has to be proved in order to convict someone of certain crimes such as first -degree murder.
 
==========malign                   To make harsh and oft en false or misleading stat ement s about .


?
 Captain Bligh of the Bounty may be one of the most unjust ly maligned figures in Brit ish naval hist ory.


Malign is relat ed to verbs like defame, slander, and libel. The person or group being maligned is the vict im of false or misleading stat ement s, even if the maligner isn't necessarily guilt y of deliberat e lying. Someone or something that 's frequent ly crit icized is oft en said to be "much maligned," which suggest s that the crit icism isn't ent irely fair or deserved. Malign is also an adject ive, and writ ers oft en refer to a person's malign influence. The very similar malignant, which used to be a common synonym of malign, t oday t ends to describe dangerous medical condit ions, especially cancerous t umors.
 
==========malnourished
     Badly or poorly nourished.


?
 When they finally found the children in the locked cabin, they were pale and malnourished but unharmed.


Malnourished people can be found in all t ypes of societ ies. Famine and povert y are only two of the common causes of malnutrition. In wealthier societ ies, malnutrit ion is oft en the result of poor eat ing habit s. Any diet that fails to provide the nutrient s needed for health and growth can lead to malnutrit ion, and some malnourished people are act ually fat .
 
==========CATA comes from the Greek kata, one of whose meanings was "down." A catalogue is a list of it ems put down on paper, and a catapult is a weapon for hurling missiles down on one's enemies.
 
==========cataclysm                        (1) A violentand massive change of the earth's surface. (2) A moment ous event thatresult s in great upheaval and oft en destruct ion.


?
 World War I was a great cataclysm in modern hist ory, marking the end of the old European social and polit ical order.


The -clysm part of cataclysm comes from the Greek word meaning "t o wash," so cataclysm's original meaning was "flood, deluge," and especially Noah's Flood it self. A cataclysm causes greatand last ing changes. An earthquake or other nat ural disast er that changes the landscape is one kind of cataclysm, buta violent polit ical revolut ion may also be a cataclysmic event . Many cataclysms could inst ead be called catastrophes.
 
==========catacomb                   An  underground  cemet ery  of  connect ing  passageways  with recesses for t ombs.


?
 The early Christ ian catacombs of Rome provide a striking glimpse int o the ancient past for modern-day visit ors.


About fort y Christ ian catacombs have been found near the roads that once led int o Rome. Aft er the decline of the Roman empire these cemet eries were forgot t en, not to be rediscovered unt il 1578. Catacomb has come to refer to different kinds of underground chambers and passageways. The catacombs of Paris are abandoned st one quarries that were not used for burials unt il 1787. The catacombs built by a monast ery in Palermo, Sicily, for it s deceased members lat er began accept ing bodies from out side the monast ery; t oday you may wander through looking athundreds of mummified corpses propped against the catacomb walls, dressed in tat t ered clothes that were once fashionable.
 
==========catalyst                    (1) A substance that  speeds up a chemical react ion or let s it  take place under different condit ions. (2) Someone or something that brings about or speeds significant change or act ion.


?
 The assassinat ion of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo in 1914 t urned out to be the catalyst for World War I.


Chemical catalyst s are substances that , in very small amount s, can bring about important chemical changes in large quant it ies of mat erial. The catalytic convert er in your car's exhaust syst em, for instance, uses t iny amount s of plat inum to swift ly convert the engine's dangerous gases to carbon dioxide and wat er vapor. And it 's easy to see how the meaning of catalyst could broaden to include nonchemical sit uat ions. We can now say, for example, that the Great Depression served as the catalyst for such important social reforms as Social Securit y.
 
==========catat onic                     (1) Relat ing to or suffering from a form of schizophrenia. (2) Showing an unusual lack of movement , act ivit y, or expression.


?
 Aft er an hour, extreme boredom had produced a catat onic st upor in those of the audience who were st ill awake.


Catatonia is primarily a form of the t errible mental disease known as schizophrenia, though it may show up in pat ient s with a variet y of other mental condit ions. A common sympt om is extreme muscular rigidit y; catat onic pat ient s may be "frozen" for hours or even days in a single posit ion. It s causes remain myst erious. Serious though the condit ion is, most nondoct ors use catatonic humorously to describe people who seem incapable of moving or changing expression.

==========PROT/PROTO comes from Greek and has the basic meaning "first in t ime" or "first formed." Protozoa are one-celled animals, such as amoebas and paramecia, thatare among the most basic members of the biological kingdom. A proton is an elementary part icle that , along with neutrons, can be found in all at omic nuclei. A protoplanet is a whirling mass of gas and dust thatastronomers believe may someday become a planet .
 
==========protagonist
 The main charact er in a lit erary work.


?
 Macbeth is the ruthlessly ambit ious protagonist of Shakespeare's play, but it is his wife who pulls the strings.


Struggle, or conflict , is central to drama. The protagonist or hero of a play, novel, or film is involved in a struggle of some kind, either against someone or something else or even againsthis or her own emot ions. So the hero is the "first struggler," which is the lit eral meaning of the Greek word         prtagnists. A charact er who opposes the hero is the antagonist, from a Greek verb that means lit erally "t o struggle against ."
 
==========prot ocol                         (1) A code of diplomat ic or military rules of behavior. (2) A set of rules for the format t ing of data in an electronic communicat ions syst em.


?
 The guest s at the governor's dinner were introduced and seat ed according to the strict prot ocol governing such occasions.


The basic meaning of proto- is a lit t le harder to follow in this word. Protocol comes from a Greek word for the first sheet of a papyrus roll. In English, protocol originally meant "a first draft or record," and lat er specifically the first draft of a diplomat ic document , such as a treaty. The "diplomat ic" connect ion led event ually to it s current meaning of "rules of behavior." Someone wearing Bermuda short s and sandals to a stat e dinner at the Whit e House would not be act ing "according to prot ocol," and royal prot ocol forbids t ouching the queen of England except to shake her hand. But protocol is also now used for other set s of rules, such as those for doing a scient ific experiment or for handling comput er data.
 
==========prot oplasm
    The substance that makes up the living part s of cells.


?
 A mixt ure of organic and inorganic substances, such as prot ein and wat er, prot oplasm is regarded as the physical basis of life.


Aft er the word protoplasm was coined in the mid-19th cent ury for the jellylike mat erial that is the main substance of a cell, it began to be used widely, especially by scient ist s and others who imagined that the first life-forms musthave arisen out of a great seething protoplasmic soup. Since prot oplasm includes all the cell's living mat erial, inside and out side the nucleus, it is a less useful scient ific word t oday than more precise t erms such as cytoplasm, which refers only to the living mat erial out side the nucleus. But many remain fascinat ed by the image of that soup bubbling away as the light ning flashes and the volcanoes erupt .
 
==========prot ot ype              (1) An original model on which something is pat t erned. (2) A first , full-scale, usually working version of a new t ype or design.


?
 There was great excit ement when, aft er years of t op-secret development , the prot ot ype of the new St ealth bomber first t ook to the skies.


A prot ot ype is someone or something that serves as a model or inspirat ion. A successful fund- raising campaign can serve as a prot ot ype for fut ure campaigns, for example, and the legendary Robin Hood is the prototypical honorable out law, the inspirat ion for count less other romant ic heroes. But the t erm is perhaps most widely used in the world of t echnology; every new "concept car," for example, start s off as a unique prot ot ype.
 
==========ANTE is Latin for "before" or "in front of." Antediluvian, which describes something very old or out dat ed, lit erally means "before the flood"-that is, Noah's Flood. And antebellum lit erally means "before the war," usually the American Civil War.
 
==========ant echamber
   An out er room that leads to another and is oft en used as a wait ing room.


?
 The ant echamber to the lawyer's office was both elegantand comfortable, designed to inspire trustand confidence.


One expect s to find an ant echamber out side the privat e chambers of a Supreme Court Just ice or leading int o the greathall of a medieval cast le. In the privat e end of the cast le the lord's or lady's bedchamber would have it s own ant echamber, which served as a dressing room and sit t ing room, but could also house bodyguards if the cast le came under siege. Anteroom is a less formal synonym, one that 's oft en applied to the wait ing rooms of professional offices t oday.
 
==========ant edat e                        (1) To dat e something (such as a check) with a dat e earlier than that of act ual writ ing. (2) To precede in t ime.

 Nant ucket Island has hundreds of beaut ifully preserved houses thatant edat e the Civil War.


Dinosaurs ant edat ed the firsthuman beings by almost 65 million years, though this st ubborn fact never used to st op cart oonist s and screenwrit ers from having the two species inhabit the same st ory line. Dict ionary edit ors are constant ly not icing how the oral use of a word may ant edat e it s firstappearance in print by a number of years. Ant edat ing a check or a contract isn't illegal unless it 's done for the purpose of fraud (the same is true of it s opposit e, postdating).
 
==========ant ecedent
(1) A word or phrase that is referred to by a pronoun that follows it . (2) An event or cause coming before something.


?
 As I remember, she said "My uncle is taking my father, and he's staying overnight ," but I'm not sure what the ant ecedent of "he" was.


A basic principle of clear writ ing is to keep your ant ecedent s clear. Pronouns are oft en used in order not to repeata noun (so inst ead of saying "Sheila t urns 22 t omorrow, and Sheila is having a part y," we replace the second "Sheila" with "she"). But sloppy writ ers somet imes leave their ant ecedent s unclear (for instance, "Sheila helps Kathleen out , but she doesn'tappreciat e it ," where it isn't clear who "she" is). Wat ch out for this possible problem when using not justhe and she butalso they, them, it, this, and that. And keep in mind thatantecedent isn't justa grammar t erm. You may talk about the ant ecedent s of heart disease (such as bad eat ing habit s), the ant ecedent s of World War I (such as the unwise Treat y of Versailles), and even your own ant ecedent s (your mother, grandfather, et c.).
 
==========ant erior

?
 When she moved up to join the first -class passengers in the plane's ant erior sect ion, she was delight ed to recognize the governor in the next seat .


Anterior generally appears in either medical or scholarly cont ext s. Anat omy books refer to the ant erior lobe of the brain, the ant erior cerebral art ery, the ant erior facial vein, et c. Scholar and lawyers may use anterior to mean "earlier in t ime or order." For example, support ers of stat es' right s point out that the individual stat es enjoyed certain right s ant erior to their joining the union. And prenupt ial agreement s are designed to prot ect the asset s that one or both part ies acquired ant erior to the marriage.

==========orthodont ics
  A branch of dent istry that deals with the treat mentand correct ion of crooked t eeth and other irregularit ies.


?
 A specialt y in orthodont ics would require three more years of st udy aft er complet ing her dent istry degree.


Orthodont ics has been pract iced since ancient t imes, but the elaborat e t echniques familiar to us t oday were introduced only in recent decades. Braces, retainers, and headgear are used to fix such condit ions as crowding of the t eeth and overbit es. According to a 1939 t ext , "Speech defect s, psychiatric dist urbances, personalit y changes, . . . all are correctable through orthodontic measures," though many adolescent s, having endured the embarrassment of rubber bands breaking and even of entangling their braces while kissing, might disagree.
 
==========orthodox                   (1)  Holding   established   beliefs,  especially  in   religion.  (2) Conforming to established rules or tradit ions; convent ional.


?
 The O'Briens remain orthodox Catholics, faithfully observing the t ime-honored rit uals of their church.


An orthodox religious belief or int erpretat ion is one handed down by a church's founders or leaders. When capitalized, as in Orthodox Judaism, Orthodox refers to a branch within a larger religious organizat ion  that  claims to honor the  religion's  original or tradit ional beliefs. The st eadfastholding of established beliefs that is seen in religious orthodoxy is apparentalso in other kinds of orthodox  behavior. Orthodox  medical  treat ment , for  example, follows  the established pract ices of mainstream medicine. Unorthodox thinking is known in business language as "thinking out side the box."
 
==========orthopedics
     The  correct ion  or  prevent ion  of  deformit ies  of  the skelet on.


?
 For surgery to correct  the  child's  spinal curvat ure, they  were  referred to the  hospital's orthopedics sect ion.


Justas an orthodont ist correct s crookedness in the t eeth, an orthopedist correct s crookedness in the skelet on. Orthopedics is formed in part from the Greek word for "child," and many orthopedic pat ient s are in fact children. Butadult s also oft en have need of orthopedic therapy, as when suffering from a joint disease like arthrit is or when recovering from a broken arm or leg.
 
==========orthography
The  spelling  of  words,  especially  spelling  according to standard usage.


?
 Even such eloquent writ ers as George Washingt on and Thomas Jefferson were deficient in the skill of orthography.


Even as recent ly as the 19th cent ury, the orthography of the English language  was st ill unset t led. Not unt il spelling books like Noah Webst er's and t ext books like "McGuffey's Readers" came along did uniform spelling become established in the U.S. Before that , there was much orthographic variat ion, even among the more educat ed. The many people who st ill have problems with spelling can take heart from Mark Twain, who once remarked, "I don't give a damn for a man that can spell a word only one way."
 
==========RECT comes from the Latin word rectus, which means "straight "  or  "right ."  To correct something is to make itright . A rectangle is a four-sided figure with straight parallel sides. Rectus, short for Latin rectus musculus, may refer to any of several straight muscles, such as those of the abdomen.
 
==========rect it ude
Moral int egrit y.


?
 The school superint endent was st ern and not t erribly popular, but no one quest ioned her moral rect it ude.


We associat e straight ness with honest y, so if we suspect someone is lying we mightask if they're being "straight " with us, and we might call a lawbreaker crooked or label him a crook. Rectitude may sound a lit t le old-fashioned t oday, but the virt ue itrepresent s never really goes out of st yle.
 
==========rect ify                       To setright ; remedy.


?
 The college is moving to rect ify this unfort unat e sit uat ion before anyone else get s hurt .


We rect ify something by straight ening it out or making itright . We mightrect ify an injust ice by seeing to it thata wrongly accused person is cleared. An error in a financial record can be rect ified by replacing an incorrect number with a correct one. If the error is in our tax ret urn, the Int ernal Revenue Service will be happy to rect ify it for us; we might then have to rect ify the impression that we were trying to cheat on our taxes.
 
==========rect ilinear

?
 Aft er admiring Frank Lloyd Wright 's rect ilinear buildings for years, the public was ast onished by the giant spiral of the Guggenheim Museum.


Rect ilinear pat t erns or construct ions are those in which straight lines are strikingly obvious. In geometry, rectilinear usually means "perpendicular"; thus, a rect ilinear polygon is a many-sided shape whose angles are all rightangles (the foot print s of mosthouses, with their ext ensions and garages, are good examples). Butrectilinear is part icularly used in physics. Rect ilinear mot ion is mot ion in which the speed remains constantand the path is a straight line; and rect ilinear rays, such as lightrays, travel in a straight line.

?
 Eugenic t echniques have been part of sheep breeding for many years.


The word eugenic, like the name Eugene, includes the Greek root meaning "born" (see GEN). Breeders of farm animals have long used eugenic methods to produce horses thatrun fast er, for example, or pigs that provide more meat . Through eugenics, Holst ein cows have become one of the world's highest producers of milk. But eugenics also has a dark side. The idea of human eugenics was taken up enthusiast ically by the Nazis in the 20th cent ury, with t errible consequences.

 The Vict orians, uncomfortable with the physical side of human exist ence, had euphemisms for most bodily funct ions.


The use of euphemisms is an ancient part of the English language, and perhaps of all languages, and all of us use them. Golly and gosh start ed outas euphemisms for God, and darn is a  familiar  euphemism  for damn.  Shoot,  shucks,  and sugar  are  all euphemistic subst it ut es for a well-known vulgar word. Pass away for die, misspeak for lie, downsize for fire, senior citizen for old person-the list goes on and on.
 
==========euphoria
A strong feeling of well-being or happiness.


?
 Swept up in the euphoria of a Super Bowl vict ory, the whole cit y seemed to have poured out int o the street s.


Euphoria is the feeling of an int ense (and usually t emporary) "high." Doct ors use the word for the kind of abnormal or inappropriat e high spirit s that might be caused by a drug or by mental illness, but euphoria is usually nat ural and appropriat e. When we win enough money in the lot t ery to buy several small Pacific islands, or even just when the home t eam wins the championship, we have good reason to feel euphoric.
 
==========eulogy             (1) A formal speech or writ ing especially in honor of a dead person. (2) High praise.


?
 The book was a fond eulogy to the 1950s, when Americans had joined social organizat ions of all kinds.


With it s -logy ending (see LOG), eulogy means lit erally something like "good speech." We are t old to speak only good of the dead, buta eulogistact ually makes a speech in the dead person's honor-or oft en inst ead for  someone living, who mightact ually be there in the audience. The most famous eulogies include Lincoln's Get t ysburg Address and Pericles' funeral orat ion for the Athenian warriors; but these are only two of the many great eulogies, which cont inue to be delivered not only at funerals and memorial services butatret irement part ies, anniversary part ies, and birthday part ies.

 For a 10-year-old Brit ish boy, boarding school could be a grim dyst opia, with no comfort s, harsh punishment s, and constant bullying.


Dystopia was creat ed from Ut opia, the name of an ideal country imagined by Sir Thomas More in 1516. For More, the suffix -topia meant "place" (see TOP), and u- (from the Greek root ou) meant "no," butalso perhaps "good" (see EU). In other words, More's Ut opia was t oo good to be true. It 's probably no accident that dystopia was first used around 1950, soon aft er George Orwell published  his famous novel Nineteen Eighty-Four and 16 years aft er Aldous Huxley published Brave New World. These two are st ill the most famous of the 20th cent ury's many depressingly dystopian novels. And whataboutall those bleak fut urist ic films: Blade Runner, Brazil, The Matrix, and the rest ?

Dyslexia is  a  neurological  disorder  that  usually  affect s  people  of  average  or  superior int elligence. Dyslexic individuals have an impaired abilit y to recognize and process words and let t ers. Dyslexia usually shows it self in the t endency to read and writ e words and let t ers in reversed order; somet imes similar reversals occur in the person's speech. Dyslexia has been shown to be treatable through pat ient instruct ion in proper reading t echniques.

 For decades the dyspept ic columnist served as the newspaper's-and the cit y's-resident grouch.


Dyspepsia comes from the Greek word for "bad digest ion." Int erest ingly, the Greek verb pessein can mean either "t o cook" or "t o digest "; bad cooking has been responsible for a lot of dyspepsia. Dyspepsia can be caused by many diseases, but dyspept ic individuals are oft en the vict ims of their own habit s and appet it es. Worry, overeat ing, inadequat e chewing, and excessive smoking and drinking can all bring on dyspepsia. Today we generally use dyspeptic to mean "irritable"-that is, in the kind of mood that could be produced by bad digest ion.

a fort iori

?
 If drug users are going to be subject to mandat ory sent ences, then, a fort iori, drug dealers should be subject to them also.


A fortiori in Latin lit erally means "from the stronger (argument )." The t erm is used when drawing a conclusion that 's even more obvious or convincing than the one just drawn. Thus, if t eaching English grammar to nat ive speakers is difficult , then, a fort iori, t eaching English grammar to nonnat ive speakers will be even more challenging.
 
==========a  post eriori
  Relat ing to or  derived  by  reasoning  from  known  or observed fact s.


?
 Most President s will come to the a post eriori conclusion thata booming economy is ent irely due to their own economic policies.


A posteriori , Latin for "from the lat t er," is a t erm from logic, which usually refers to reasoning that works backward from an effect to it s causes. This kind of reasoning can somet imes lead to false conclusions. The fact that sunrise  follows the  crowing of a  roost er, for example, doesn't necessarily mean that the roost er's crowing caused the sun to rise.
 
==========a priori
 Relat ing to or derived by reasoning from self-evident proposit ions.


?
 Her colleagues reject ed the a priori argument  because it  rest ed on assumpt ions they felt weren't necessarily true.


A priori, Latin for "from the former," is tradit ionally contrast ed with a posteriori (see above). The t erm usually describes lines of reasoning or argument s that proceed from the general to the part icular, or from causes to effect s. Whereas a post eriori knowledge is knowledge based solely on experience or personal observat ion, a priori knowledge is knowledge that comes from the power of reasoning based on self-evident truths. So, for example, "Every mother has had a child" is an a priori stat ement , since it shows simple logical reasoning and isn'ta stat ement of factabouta specific case (such as "This woman is the mother of five children") that the speaker knew about from experience.

?
 According to the broker, they've made a bona fide offer to buy the propert y.


Bona fide means "in good faith" in Latin. When applied to business deals and the like, it stresses the absence  of fraud  or decept ion. A bona fide sale of securit ies is an ent irely aboveboard transact ion. Out side of business and law, bona fide implies mere sincerit y and earnest ness. A bona fide promise is one that  the person has every int ent ion of keeping. A bona fide proposal of marriage is one made by a suit or who isn't kidding around. Bona fide also has the noun form bona fides; when someone asks about someone else's bona fides, it usually means evidence of their qualificat ions or achievement s.

?
 When he learned the phrase "Carpe diem" in high-school Latin class, he knew he'd found the mot to he would live by for the rest of his life.


Carpe diem, a phrase that comes from the Roman poethorace, means lit erally "Pluck the day," though it 's usually translat ed as "Seize the day." A free translat ion might be "Enjoy yourself while you have the chance." For some people, Carpe diem serves as the closest thing to a philosophy of life as they'll ever have.
 
==========caveat empt or
          Let the buyer beware.


?
 The bestrule to keep in mind when buying anything from a pushcart is: "Caveat empt or."


"Withouta warrant y, the buyer must take the risk" is the basic meaning of the phrase caveat emptor. In the days when buying and selling was carried on in the local market place, the rule was a pract ical one. Buyer and seller knew each other and were on equal foot ing. The nat ure of modern commerce and t echnology placed the buyer ata disadvantage, however, so a stack of regulat ions have been writ t en by federal, stat e, and local agencies to prot ect the consumer against dangerous or defect ive product s, fraudulent pract ices, and the like. But the principle thata buyer needs a warrant y if he is to avoid risk remains an important legal concept . Not e thata caveat is a small warning or explanat ion int ended to avoid misint erpretat ion.

 The police believed they had solved the crime, but couldn't prove their case without the corpus delict i.


Corpus delicti lit erally means "body of the crime" in Latin. In it s original sense, the body in quest ion refers not to a corpse but to the body of essent ial fact s that , taken t ogether, prove thata crime has been commit t ed. In popular usage, corpus delicti also refers to the act ual physical object upon which a crime has been commit t ed. In a case of arson, it would be a ruined building; in a murder case, the vict im's corpse.
 
==========curriculum   vitae

?
 The job advert isementasked for an up-t o-dat e curriculum vitae and three recommendat ions.


The Latin phrase curriculum vitae, oft en abbreviat ed CV, lit erally means "the course of one's life." The t erm is usually used for applicat ions for jobs in the sciences and medicine and for t eaching posit ions in colleges and universit ies. A short er t erm is simply vita, meaning "life." In other fields, rsum is more commonly used in the U.S.; in England, however, curriculum vitae is the usual t erm for any job applicat ion.

EQU QUIS PLE/PLEN METR/METER AUD SON ERR CED WordsfromMythologyandHist ory
Quiz6-1 Quiz6-2 Quiz6-3 Quiz6-4 Quiz6-5 ReviewQuizzes6

EQU comes from the Latin word aequus, meaning "equal." To equalize means to make things equal. Things thatare equivalenthave the same value, use, or meaning. All three sides of an equilateral triangle are of the same length. And an equation (for instance, 21 + 47 = 68) is a stat ement that two mathemat ical expressions are equal.
 
==========equable                     (1) Tending to remain calm. (2) Free from harsh changes or extreme variat ion.


?
 Her friends thought it odd that such an equable woman had married a man so moody and unpredictable.


Equable usually describes either climat e or personalit y. The word seems to be used less t oday than in decades past , maybe because the personalit y t ype is less admired than it used to be. A st eady, calm, equable personalit y may not produce much excit ement but usually makes for a good worker and a good parent , and maybe even a longer life. In the words of the poetrobert Service: "Avoid extremes: be moderat e / In saving and in spending. / An equable and easy gait / Will win an easy ending."
 
==========adequacy
   Being equal to some need or requirement .


?
 Environmentalist s doubt the adequacy of these regulat ions to prot ect the wilderness areas.


When we quest ion the adequacy of health-care coverage, or parking facilit ies, or school funding, we're asking if they are equal to our need. The adject ive adequate means "enough" or "acceptable"-though in sent ences like "His performance was adequat e," itreally means "no bet t er than acceptable."
 
==========equilibrium
  (1) A stat e in which opposing forces are balanced so that one is not stronger or great er than the other. (2) A stat e of emot ional balance or calmness.


?
 The news had come as a shock, and it t ook him several minut es to recover his equilibrium.


Equilibrium contains a root from the  Latin libra,  meaning  "weight "  or  "balance."  As  a const ellat ion, zodiac symbol, and astrological sign, Libra is usually pict ured as a set of balance scales, oft en held by the blindfolded goddess of just ice, which symbolizes fairness, equalit y, and just ice. Equilibrium has special meanings in biology, chemistry, physics, and economics, but in all of them itrefers to the balance of compet ing influences.
 
==========equinox
    A day when day and nightare the same length.


?
 She and her friends got t ogether for an equinox part y t wice a year to celebrat e the arrival of the fall and the spring.


If you know that nox means "night " in Latin, it 's nothard to remember the meaning of equinox. There are two equinoxes in the year: the spring equinox, around March 21, and the fall equinox, around Sept ember 23. The equinoxes are  contrast ed  with  the solstices, when the sun is farthest north and south of the equat or. The summer solst ice occurs around June 22 (the longest day of the year), the wint er solst ice around December 22 (the short est day).
 
==========QUIS is derived from the Latin verb meaning "t o seek or obtain." The root s quer, quir, and ques
are derived from the same Latin verb and give us words such as inquiry and question.
 
==========inquisit ion
    A quest ioning or examining that is oft en harsh or severe.


?
 The President 's first choice for the job t urned him down, fearing the Senat e hearings would t urn int o an inquisit ion int o her past .


While an inquiry can be almostany search for truth, the relat ed word inquisition suggest s a long, thorough invest igat ion that involves ext ensive and harsh quest ioning. Though the two words originally had about the same meaning, t oday inquisition t ends to remind us of the Spanish Inquisit ion, an ongoing trial conduct ed by church-appoint ed inquisitors that began in the Middle Ages and sought out nonbelievers, Jews, and Muslims, thousands of whom were sent enced to t ort ure and to burning at the stake.
 
==========perquisit e                       (1) A privilege or profit that is provided in addit ion to one's base salary. (2) Something claimed as an exclusive possession or right .


?
 A new car, a big house, and yearly trips to Europe were among the perquisit es that made the presidency of Wyndam College such an at tract ive posit ion.


Though the Latin source of perquisite originally meant "something insist ent ly asked for," the "ask" meaning has most ly vanished from the English word. A perquisit e, oft en called simply a perk, is inst ead something of value that the holder of a part icular job or posit ion is ent it led t o, usually without even asking. The President of the Unit ed Stat es, for instance, enjoys  as perquisit es the use of Camp David and Air Force One. Perhaps because perquisit es are usually available to only a small number of people, the word somet imes refers to non-job-relat ed privileges thatare claimed as exclusive right s.
 
==========acquisit ive
  Eager to acquire; greedy.


?
 With each year the couple became more madly acquisit ive, buying jewelry, a huge yacht , and two country estat es.


Unlike most tribal peoples and the populat ions of some older countries, we Americans live in an acquisit ive societ y, a societ y devot ed to get t ing and spending. And America oft en makes successfully acquisit ive people int o heroes; even Ebenezer Scrooge, that model of miserly greed and acquisitiveness, was once defended by a Whit e House chief of staff. An acquisit ive nat ion may seek to acquire other t errit ories by force. But mental acquisition of specialized knowledge or skills-or new vocabulary!-doesn't deprive others of the same informat ion.
 
==========requisit ion
    A demand or request  (such as for supplies) made with proper authorit y.


?
 The t eachers had grown impat ient with having to submita requisit ion for even rout ine classroom supplies.


Requisition was originally a noun but is now probably more common as a verb. So we either can speak of sending our office's purchasing depart menta requisit ion for comput ers, or of requisitioning more comput ers from the depart ment . The word has an official sound to it . However, one of Hollywood's bit t ersweet love st ories begins when Omar Sharif, playing a World War I freedom fight er, says to Ingrid Bergman, who is the owner of a stat ely old yellow Rolls Royce, "I've come to requisit ion your car."

==========PLE/PLEN comes from a Latin word meaning "t o fill."  It  can be seen in the words plenty, meaning basically "filled," and complete, meaning "thoroughly filled."
 
==========plenary                          (1) Including all who have a right to at t end. (2) Complet e in all ways.


?
 For the convent ion's plenary session, five thousand members gathered to hear a star speaker.


Plenary oft en shows up in writ ing referring to the "plenary power" held by a government , and is part icularly used for powers ment ioned in a const it ut ion.  For  example,  under  the  U.S. Const it ut ion, the Congress has plenary power to wage war, which means that no one else- not the court s, not the stat es, not the president -has any power what soever to second-guess Congress about warmaking. But  in recent  years, that  hasn't  st opped some president s from start ing conflict s that looked a lot like wars to most people. Ata conference, the plenary sessions (unlike the various smaller "presentat ions,"  "workshops,"  "forums,"  and "seminars" that otherwise fill the day) try to bring everyone t ogether in the same room.
 
==========complement
(1) Something that fills up or makes perfect ; the amount needed to make something complet e. (2) A count erpart .


?
 On the commit t ee, the two young people provided an energet ic complement to the older members.


A complement fills out or balances something. We think of saltas the complement of pepper (maybe most ly because of their colors), and the right neckt ie is a perfect complement to a good suit . Complement can also mean "the full quant it y, number, or amount "; thus, a ship's complement of officers and crew is the whole force necessary for full operat ion. Complement is act ually most common as a verb; we may say, for example, thata bright blue scarf complements a cream-colored out fit beaut ifully. Don't confuse complement with compliment, which means an expression of respect or affect ion.
 
==========deplet e                   To reduce in amount by using up.


?
 Years of farming on the same small plot of land had left the soil deplet ed of minerals.


The de- prefix oft en means "do the opposit e of," so deplete means the opposit e of "fill." Thus, for example, a kit chen's food supplies can be rapidly deplet ed by hungry  t eenagers. But deplete oft en suggest s something more serious. Desert ions can deplet e an army; layoffs can deplet e an office staff; and t oo much t ime in bed can rapidly deplet e your muscular strength.
 
==========replet e                  Fully or abundant ly filled or supplied.


?
 The professor's aut obiography was replet e with scandalous anecdot es about campus life in the 1950s.


Replete implies that something is filled almost to capacit y. Aut umn landscapes in New England are replet e with colorful foliage. Supermarket tabloids are always replet e with details of stars' lives, whether real or imaginary. And a professor may complain that most of the papers she received were replet e with errors in grammar and punct uat ion.
 
==========METR/METER comes to us from Greek by way of Latin; in both languages itrefers to "measure." A thermometer measures heat ; a perimeter is the measure around something; and things thatare isometric are equal in measure.
 
==========metric                 (1) Relat ing to or based on the metric syst em. (2) Relat ing to or arranged in met er.


?
 Americans have resist ed using the metric syst em for years, butare now slowly get t ing accust omed to a few of the metric unit s.


The metric syst em was invent ed in France in the years following the French Revolut ion, and a version of it is now used in most of the world to measure distance, weight , and volume. Basic metric unit s include the kilogram (the basic unit of weight ), the liter (the basic unit of volume), and of course the meter (the basic unit of length-see below). Metric-or more oft en metrical- can also refer to the basic underlying rhythm of songs and poetry. So while the scient ist s' measurement s are usually metric, the poet s' are usually metrical.
 
==========met er                 (1) The basic metric unit  of length, equal to about  39.37 inches. (2) A syst emat ic rhythm in poetry or music.


?
 The basic met er of the piece was 3/4, but it s rhythms were so complicat ed that the 3/4 was somet imes hard to hear.


Meter is a metric measurement slight ly longer than a yard; thus, a 100-met er dash might take you a second longer than a 100-yard dash. But the word has a different sense in music, where people aren't separat ed by whether they use the metric syst em. For a musician, the met er is the regular background rhythm, expressed by the "t ime signat ure" writ t en at the beginning of a piece or sect ion: 2/2, 2/4, 3/8, 4/4, 6/8, et c. Within a met er, you can creat e rhythms thatrange from the simple to the complex. So, for example, "America the Beaut iful" is in 4/4 met er (or "4/4 t ime"), but so are most of the rhythmically complex songs writ t en by Paul Simon, Burt Bacharach, or St evie Wonder. In ordinary conversat ion, though, most people use "rhythm" to include met er and everything that 's built on t op of it . In poetry, met er has much the same meaning; however, poet ic met ers aren't named with numbers but inst ead with  tradit ional Greek and Latin t erms such as iambic and dactylic.
 
==========odomet er
    An instrument used to measure distance traveled.


?
 Jennifer wat ched the odomet er to see how far she would have to drive to her new job.


Odometer includes the root from the Greek word hodos, meaning "road" or "trip." An odomet er shares space on your dashboard with a speedomet er, a tachomet er, and maybe a "tripmet er." The odomet er is what crooked car salesmen tamper with when they want to reduce the mileage a car regist ers as having traveled. One of life's lit t le pleasures  is  wat ching  the odomet er as all the numbers change at the same t ime.
 
==========tachomet er
     A device used to measure speed of rotat ion.


?
 Even though one purpose of a tachomet er is to help drivers keep their engine speeds down, some of us occasionally try to see how high we can make the needle go.


A tachomet er is lit erally a "speed-measurer," since the Greek root tach- means "speed." This is clear in the names of the tachyon, a part icle of mat t er that travels fast er than the speed of light (if itact ually exist s, it 's so fast that it 's impossible to see with any instrument ), and tachycardia, a medical condit ion in which the heartraces uncontrollably. Since the speed thatan aut o tachomet er measures is speed of rotat ion of the crankshaft , the numbers itreport s are revolut ions per minut e, or rpm's.

==========AUD, from the Latin verb audire, is the root thathas to do with hearing. What is audible can be heard. An audience is a group of list eners, somet imes seat ed in an auditorium.  And audio t oday can mean almostanything thathas to do with sound.
 
==========audit or                        A person who formally examines and verifies financial account s.


?
 It seems impossible that so many banks could have got t en int o so much trouble if their audit ors had been doing their jobs.


The auditing of a company's financial records by independent examiners on a regular basis is necessary to prevent "cooking the books," and thus to keep the company honest . We don't normally think of audit ors as list ening, since looking atand adding up numbers is their basic line of work, butaudit ors do have to list en to people's  explanat ions, and  perhaps  that 's  the hist orical link. Hearing is more obviously part of another meaning of audit, the kind that college st udent s do when they sit in on a class without taking exams or receiving an official grade.
 
==========audit ory
  (1) Perceived or experienced through hearing. (2) Of or relat ing to the sense or organs of hearing.


?
 With the "surround-sound" syst ems in most theat ers, going to a movie is now an audit ory experience as much as a visual one.


Auditory is close in meaning to acoustic and acoustical, butauditory usually refers more to hearing than to sound. For instance, many dogs have greataudit ory (notacoust ic) powers, and th e auditory nerve let s us hear by connect ing the inner ear to the brain. Acoustic and acoustical inst ead refer especially to instrument s and the condit ions under which sound can be heard; so archit ect s concern themselves with the acoust ic propert ies of an audit orium, and instrument makers with those of a clarinet or piano.
 
==========audit ion                          A trial performance to evaluat e a performer's skills.


?
 Audit ions for Broadway shows at tract so many hopeful unknown performers that everyone in the business calls them "cat t le calls."


Most stars are discovered ataudit ions, where a number of candidat es read the same partand the direct or chooses. Lana Turner famously skipped the audit ion process and was inst ead discovered by an agent sipping a soda in a Sunset Boulevard caf atage 16. Audition can also be a verb; so, for example, aft er Miss Turner gained her stardom, act ors had to audit ion to be her leading man. But when musicians audit ion for a job in an orchestra, it 's usually behind a screen so that the judges won't even know their sex and therefore can't do anything but list en.
 
==========inaudible
 Notheard or capable of being heard.


?
 The coach spoke to her in a low voice that was inaudible to the rest of the gymnast ics t eam.


With it s negat ive prefix in-, inaudible means the opposit e of audible. What 's clearly audible to you may be inaudible to your elderly grandfather. Modern spy t echnology can t urn inaudible conversat ions int o audible ones with the use of high-powered direct ional microphones, so if you think you're being spied on, make sure there's a lot of other noise around you. And if you don't want everyone around you to know you're bored, keep your sighs inaudible.
 
==========SON is the Latin root meaning "sound." Sonata, meaning a piece for one or two instrument s, was originally an Italian verb meaning "sounded" (when singers were involved, the Italians used a different verb). And sonorous means full, loud, or rich in sound.
 
==========sonic          (1) Having to do with sound. (2) Having to do with the speed of sound in air (about 750 miles per hour).


?
 A sonic depth finder can easily det ermine the depth of a lake by bouncing a sound signal off the bot t om.


A sonic boom is an explosive sound creat ed by a shock wave formed at the nose of an aircraft . In 1947 a plane pilot ed by Chuck Yeager burst the "sound barrier" and creat ed the first sonic boom. In the decades aft erward sonic booms became a familiar sound to Americans. (Because of st eps that were event ually taken, sonic booms are rarely heard anymore.) Today sonic is oft en used by ambit ious rock musicians to describe their experimental sounds.
 
==========dissonant           (1) Clashing or discordant , especially in music. (2) Incompat ible or disagreeing.


?
 Crit ics of the health-care plan  point ed to it s  two seemingly  dissonant  goals:  cost containment , which would try to control spending, and universal coverage, which could increase spending.


Since dissonant includes the negat ive prefix dis-, what is dissonant sounds or feels unresolved, unharmonic, and clashing. Early in the 20th cent ury, composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and his st udent s developed the use of dissonance in music as a st yle in it self. But to many list eners, the sounds in such music are st ill unbearable, and most cont inue to prefer music based on tradit ional t onalit y. Dissonant is now oft en used withoutreferring to sound atall. Cognitive dissonance, for example, is whathappens when you believe two different things that can'tact ually both be true.
 
==========resonance
  (1) A cont inuing or echoing of sound. (2) A richness and variet y in the depth and qualit y of sound.


?
 The resonance of James Earl Jones's vocal t ones in such roles as Darth Vader made his voice one of the mostrecognizable of it s t ime.


Many of the finest musical instrument s possess a high degree of resonance which, by producing addit ional vibrat ions and echoes of  the original sound, enriches and amplifies it . Violins made by the Italian mast ers Stradivari and Guarneri possess a qualit y of resonance that lat er violinmakers have never precisely duplicat ed. And you may have not iced how a part icular not e will start something in a room buzzing, as one of the t ouching surfaces begins to resonate with the not e. Because of that , resonance and resonate-along with the adject ive resonant-aren'talways used to describe sound. For example, you may say thata novel resonat es strongly with you because the author seems to be describing your own experiences and feelings.
 
==========ultrasonic                         Having a frequency higher than what  can be heard by the human ear.


?
 My grandfather's dog is always pricking up it s ears at some ultrasonic signal, while he himself is so deaf he can't even hear a bird singing.


Ultrasound, or ultrasonography, works on the principle that sound is reflect ed at different speeds by t issues or substances of different densit ies. Ultrasound t echnology has been used medically since the 1940s. Sonograms, the pict ures produced by ultrasound, can reveal heart defect s, t umors, and gallst ones; since low-power ultrasonic waves don't presentany risks to a body, they're most  oft en used to display fet uses during pregnancy in order to make sure they're healthy. Ultrasonics has many other uses, including underwat er sonar sensing. High- power ultrasonics are so int ense that they're act ually used for drilling and welding.

==========ERR, from the Latin verb errare, means "t o wander" or "t o stray." The root is seen in the word error, meaning a wandering or straying from what is correct or true. Erratum (plural, errata) is Latin for "mistake"; so an errata page is a book page that  list s mistakes found t oo lat e to correct before the book's publicat ion.
 
==========errant          (1)  Wandering  or  moving  about  aimlessly. (2)  Straying  out side  proper bounds, or away from an accept ed pat t ern or standard.


?
 Modern-day cowboys have been known to use helicopt ers to spot errant calves.


Errant means both "wandering" and "mistaken." A knight-errant was a wandering knight who wentabout slaying dragons or rescuing damsels in distress (at least when he was on good behavior). Arrant is a old-fashioned spelling of errant; an arrant knave (the phrase comes from Shakespeare) is an extremely untrust worthy individual. An errant sock might be one that 's got t en lost ; an errant polit ician might be one who's been caught cheat ing; and an errant cloud might be one that float s by all alone in a deep-blue sky on a summer day.
 
==========aberrant                          Straying or differing from the right , normal, or nat ural t ype.


?
 Sullivan's increasingly  aberrant  behavior  was  leading  his  friends to quest ion  his  mental stabilit y.


Something aberranthas wandered away from the usual path or form. The word is generally used in a negat ive way; aberrant behavior, for example, may be a sympt om of other problems. But the discovery of an aberrant variet y of a species can be excit ing news to a biologist , and ident ifying an aberrant gene has led the way to new treat ment s for diseases.
 
==========errat ic                   (1) Having no fixed course. (2) Lacking in consist ency.


?
 In the 1993 World Series, the Phillies weren'thelped by the errat ic performance of their ace relief pit cher, "Wild Thing."


Erratic can refer to lit eral "wandering." A missile that loses it s guidance syst em may follow an errat ic path, and a river with lot s of t wist s and bends is said to have an errat ic course. Erratic can also mean "inconsist ent " or "irregular." So a st ock market that oft en changes direct ion is said to be act ing erratically; an errat ic heart beat can be cause for concern; and if your car idles errat ically it may mean that something's wrong with the spark-plug wiring.
 
==========erroneous                           Mistaken, incorrect .


?
 For years her parent s had had an erroneous idea of her int elligence, because she didn't begin to talk unt il the age of six.


Erroneous basically means "containing errors," and, since most of us are constant ly suffering from mistaken not ions, the word is oft en used in front of words such as "assumpt ion" and "idea." It 's also used to describe the kind of mistaken informat ion that can lead to erroneous theories, erroneous conclusions, and erroneous decisions.
 
==========CED comes from the Latin verb cedere, meaning "t o proceed" or "t o yield." Proceed it self employs the root , as does recede, and their relat ed nouns procession and recession employ another form of the Latin verb.
 
==========cede              To give up, especially by treaty; yield.


?
 Their 88-year-old father reluctant ly ceded control over his finances to two of the children this year.


Cede is oft en a formal t erm used in discussing t errit ory and right s, but is also used less formally. So, for example, Spain ceded Puert o Rico to the U.S. in 1898, following the Spanish- American War, and the U.S. ceded control of the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. Crit ics warn that we are ceding leadership in alt ernat ive-energy t echnology to China. Cit izens of one European country or another are always worrying that their own country is ceding t oo much power to the European Union. A t ennis player doesn'thave any choice when she cedes her no. 1 ranking to a rival.
 
==========concede                       To admit grudgingly; yield.


?
 To his friends, Senat or Beasley concedes thathis reelect ion campaign was badly run and thathe made several damaging errors.


Aft er the vot es have been count ed, one candidat e tradit ionally concedes the elect ion to his or her opponent by giving a concession speech. If you're lucky, your boss will concede that she was wrong the last t ime she crit icized you. But in the middle of an argument , we're notall so good at conceding that the other guy mighthave a good point .
 
==========accede                     (1) To give in to a request or demand. (2) To give approval or consent .


?
 This t ime Congress refused to accede to the demands of the president , and began cut t ing the funding for the war.


To accede usually means to yield, oft en under pressure and with some reluctance, to the needs or request s of others. Vot ers usually accede to a tax increase only when they're convinced it 's the only real solut ion to a short fall in government funding. A pat ient may accede to surgery only aft er the doct or assures him it 's bet t er than the alt ernat ives. If you accede to your spouse's plea to wat ch the new realit y show at 9:00, you may get to choose something bet t er at 10:00.
 
==========precedent
  Something done or said that may be an example or rule to guide lat er act s of a similar kind.


?
 When Judy bought Christ mas present s for all her relat ives one year, she claimed that it set no precedent , but it did.


A precedent is something that precedes, or comes before. The Supreme Courtrelies on precedent s-that is, earlier laws or decisions that provide some example or rule to guide them in the case they're act ually deciding. When hostages are being held for ransom, a government may worry about set t ing a bad precedent if it gives in. And a company might "break with precedent " by naming a foreigner as it s president for the first t ime.

==========Words from Mythology and History

Augean stable
  A condit ion or place marked by greataccumulat ion of filth or corrupt ion.


?
 Leaders of many of the newly formed nat ions of East ern Europe found that the old government s of their countries had become Augean stables that they must now clean out .


Augeus, the mythical king of Elis, kept great stables thatheld 3,000 oxen and had not been cleaned for thirt y years when Hercules was assigned the job as one of his famous "t welve labors." This task was enormous even for someone so might y, so Hercules shift ed the course of two rivers to make them pour through the stables. Augean by it self has come to mean "extremely difficult or distast eful", and to "clean the Augean stable" usually means either to clear away corrupt ion or to perform a large and unpleasant task that  has long called for at t ent ion. So t oday we refer to "Augean tasks," "Augean labor," or even "Augean clut t er." And  the Brit ish firm Augean PLC is-what else?
-a wast e-management company.
 
==========Croesus                      A very rich person.


?
 Warren Buffet t 's extraordinary record of acquiring  and invest ing  made him an American Croesus.


Croesus, which t ends to appear in the phrase "rich as Croesus," was the name of a king of Lydia, an ancient kingdom in what is now west ern Turkey, who died around 546 B.C. Lydia was probably the first country in hist ory to use coins, and under the wealthy and powerful Croesus the first coins of pure silver and gold were produced, which may have added to the legends surrounding his wealth. But it was Croesus who the Greek lawgiver Solon was thinking about when he said "Count no man happy  unt il  his  death"-and  indeed  Croesus  was  finally overthrown and may even have been burned alive.
 
==========dragon's t eeth
 Seeds of conflict .


?
 Many expert s believed that , in invading a Middle East ern country thathadn'tat tacked us, we were sowing dragon's t eeth.


The Phoenician prince Cadmus once killed a dragon, and was instruct ed by the goddess Athena to plant it s t eeth in the ground. From the many t eeth, there immediat ely sprang up an army of fierce armed men. The goddess then direct ed him to throw a precious st one int o their midst , and they proceeded to slaught er each other unt il only the five great est warriors were left ; these became Cadmus's generals, with whom he construct ed the great cit y-stat e of Thebes. When we "sow dragon's t eeth," we're creat ing the condit ions for fut ure trouble.
 
==========Hades                     The underground home of the dead in Greek mythology.


?
 In a dramat ic scene, he crawls up out of the ground coat ed in black petroleum as though emerging from Hades.


In Greek mythology, Hades is both the land of the dead and the god who rules there. Hades the god (who the Greeks also called Plut o) is the brother of Zeus and Poseidon, who rule the skies and the seas. The realm called Hades, where he rules with his wife Persephone, is the region under the earth, full of mineral wealth and fert ilit y and home to dead souls. Hades t oday is somet imes used as a polit e t erm for Hell ("It 's hot t er than Hades in here!").
 
==========lethargic                          (1) Lazily sluggish. (2) Indifferent or apathet ic.


?
 Once again the long Sunday dinner had left most of the family feeling st uffed and lethargic.


The philosopher Plat o wrot e that before a dead person could leave the underworld to begin a new life, he or she had to drink from the river Lethe, whose name means "forget fulness" in Greek, and forgetall aspect s of one's former life and the t ime spent in Hades (usually pret t y awful, according to Plat o). But lethargic and it s noun lethargy never act ually refer to forget t ing; inst ead, they describe the weak, ghost ly stat e of the dead spirit s-so weak that they may require a drink of blood before they can even speak.
 
==========Midas t ouch
     The talent for making money in every vent ure.


?
 Invest ors are always looking for an invest mentadviser with the Midas t ouch, butaft er a couple of good years each adviser's brilliance usually seems to vanish.


Midas was a legendary king of Phrygia (in modern-day Turkey). In ret urn for a good deed, he was grant ed one wish by the god Dionysus, and asked for the power to t urn everything he t ouched int o gold. When he discovered to his horror thathis t ouch had t urned his food and drink-and even his daught er-t o gold, he begged Dionysus to take back the gift , and Dionysus agreed to do so. When "Midas t ouch" is used t oday, the moral of this tale of greed is usually ignored.
 
==========Pyrrhic vict ory
 A vict ory won at excessive cost .


?
 That win t urned out to be a Pyrrhic vict ory, since our best players sustained injuries that would sideline them for weeks.


In 279 B.C. Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, a country in northwest Greece, defeat ed the Romans at the Bat t le of Ausculum, but lostall of his best officers and many men. He is said to have exclaimed aft er the bat t le, "One more such vict ory and we are lost ." Pyrrhic vict ories are more common than we t end to think. Whenever we win an argument but in so doing manage to offend the friend we were arguing with, or whenever a country invades another country butrouses widespread opposit ion in surrounding countries in the process, it 's probably a Pyrrhic vict ory thathas been achieved.
 
==========st ygian                       Extremely dark, dank, gloomy, and forbidding.


?
 When the power went out in the building, the halls and stairwells were plunged in st ygian darkness.


The Greek underworld of Hades was cold and dark, rather than blazing like the Christ ian image of Hell. The river St yx, whose name meant "hat eful" in Greek, was the chief river of the underground, and the souls of the dead were ferried across it s poisonous wat ers int o Hades by the boat man Charon. The St yx was so t errible that even the gods swore by it s name in their most solemn oaths. The name St ygia, borrowed from stygian, is used for a country in fantasy games t oday; buta st ygian at mosphere, a st ygian t unnel, st ygian darkness, and so on, st ill describe the dreary cheerlessness of the Greek underworld.

VIS SPECT VOC PHON CUR PERI SENS SOPH WordsfromMythologyandHist ory
Quiz7-1 Quiz7-2 Quiz7-3 Quiz7-4 Quiz7-5 ReviewQuizzes7

VIS comes from a Latin verb meaning "see." Vision is what enables us to see, visual images are visible to our eyes, and a visitor is someone who comes to see something. The same verb act ually gives us another root , vid-, as in Julius Caesar's famous stat ementabouthis military exploit s, "Veni, vidi, vici" ("I came, I saw, I conquered"), and such common English words as video.
 
==========vista                  (1) A distant view. (2) An ext ensive mental view, as over a stret ch of t ime.


?
 The economic vista for the next two years looks excellent , according to a poll of business economist s.


Vista is generally used t oday for broad sweeping views of the kind you might see from a mountaint op. But the word originally meantan avenue-like view, narrowed by a line of trees on either side. And vista has also long been used (like view and outlook) to mean a mental scan of the fut ure-as if you were riding down a long grand avenue and what you could see a mile or so ahead of you was where you'd be in the very near fut ure.
 
==========vis--vis                          In relat ion to or compared with.


?
 Many financial report ers worry about the loss of U.S. economic strength vis--vis our principal trading part ners.


Vis--vis comes from Latin by way of French, where it means lit erally "face-t o-face." In English it was first used to mean a lit t le horse-drawn carriage in which two people sat opposit e each other. From there itacquired various other meanings, such as "dancing part ner." Today it no longer refers to act ual physical faces and bodies, but it s modern meaning comes from the fact that things thatare face-t o-face can easily be compared or contrast ed. So, for example, a greyhound is very tall vis--vis a Scot t ie, and the Red Sox have oft en fared badly vis--vis the Yankees.
 
==========visionary                          (1) A person  with  foresight  and  imaginat ion. (2) A dreamer whose ideas are oft en impract ical.


?
 His followers regarded him as an inspired visionary; his opponent s saw him as either a con man or a lunat ic.


A visionary is someone with a strong vision of the fut ure. Since such visions aren'talways accurat e, a visionary's ideas may either work brilliant ly or fail miserably. Even so, visionary is usually a posit ive word. Mart in Luther King, Jr., for instance, was a visionary in his hopes and ideas for a just societ y. The word is also an adject ive; thus, for example, we may speak of a visionary project , a visionary leader, a visionary paint er, or a visionary company.
 
==========envisage                     To have a mental pict ure of; visualize.


?
 A mere three weeks aft er they had start ed dat ing, the two were already arguing, and none of us could envisage the relat ionship last ing for long.


One of the imaginat ion's most valuable uses is it s abilit y to see something in the "mind's eye"-that is, to visualize, envision, or envisage something. Envisaging a possibilit y may be one of the chief abilit ies that separat e human beings from  the other animals. What we envisage may be physical (such as a complet ed piece of furnit ure) or nonphysical (such as finishing college). Envisaging life with a puppy might lead us down to the pound to buy one, and envisaging the sinking of an island nat ion may focus our minds on climat e change.
 
==========SPECT comes from the Latin verb specere, meaning "t o look at ," and produces several familiar English words. Spectacles can be glasses that you look through; buta spectacle can also be a remarkable sight -in Roman t imes, perhaps a spectacular chariotrace or a spectacularly bloody bat t le bet ween gladiat ors and wild beast s, mount ed for the pleasure of it s spectators.
 
==========aspect                   (1) A part of something. (2) A certain way in which something appears or may be regarded.


?
 Many expert s believe the mental aspect of distance racing is more important than the physical aspect .


Since aspectus in Latin means "looked at ," an aspect of something is basically the direct ion from which it 's looked at . So we may say that travel is your favorit e aspect of your job, or that eat ing well is one aspect of a healthy life. If you look ata stage set from the front , it looks complet ely different than from behind, where all the mechanisms are visible, and both aspect s are important . The word can be very useful when you're analyzing something, and it 's used a great deal in the writ ings of scholars.
 
==========prospect                     (1) The possibilit y that something will happen in the fut ure. (2) An opport unit y for something to happen.


?
 There was lit t le prospect of a breakthrough in the negot iat ions before the elect ions.


Since the Latin prefix pro- oft en means "forward" (see PRO), prospectrefers to looking forward. The prospect of a recession may lead invest ors to pull their money out of the st ock market . Graduat es of a good law school usually have excellent prospect s for finding employment . Prospective st udent s roam campuses with their parent s in the year before they plan to ent er college.
 
==========perspect ive
    (1) Point of view; the angle, direct ion, or standpoint from which a person looks at something. (2) The art or t echnique of paint ing or drawing a scene so that object s in it seem to have depth and distance.


?
 From the perspect ive of the lowly soldier, the war looked very different .


To the modern mind, it 's hard to believe that perspect ive had to be "discovered," but before the 1400s paint ings simply lacked accurat e perspect ive. Inst ead, important people and object s were simply shown larger than less important ones; and although  distant  object s  were somet imes shown smaller than near ones, this wasn't done in a regular and accurat e way. Justas odd, many paint ings didn'trepresent the other meaning of perspective either-that is, a scene might not be shown as if it were being seen from one single place. Today, perspective is used much like standpoint. Justas standpoint once used to mean simply the physical place where you stand but t oday also means the way you "see" things as a result of who you are and what you do, the same could be said about perspective.
 
==========prospect us
   A print ed stat ement  that  describes something (such as a new business or a st ock offering) and is sent out to people who may be int erest ed in buying or invest ing.


?
 The prospect us for the mut ual fund says nothing abouthow it s profit forecast s  were calculat ed.


Like prospect, prospectus looks forward. Thus, a prospect us originally out lined something that didn't yet exist , describing  what it  would  become. This might  even  be a  book; the  great dict ionary of Noah Webst er, like that of Samuel Johnson, was firstannounced in the form of a prospect us, so that well-t o-do people mightact ually subscribe to it -that is, pay for it in advance so that Webst er would have money to live on while writ ing it . Soon, prospectus was being used to mean a descript ion of a privat e school or college, int ended to at tract new st udent s. Today the word very oft en means a descript ion of a st ock offering or mut ual fund, whether new or not .

==========VOC comes from the Latin words meaning "voice" and "speak." So a vocal ensemble is a singing group. A vocation was originally a "calling" from God to do religious work as a priest , monk, or nun, though t oday most people use the word just to mean a career. And a vocabulary is a set of words for speaking.
 
==========equivocat e
    (1) To use ambiguous language, especially in order to deceive.
(2) To avoid giving a directanswer.


?
 As the company direct ors cont inued to equivocat e, the union prepared to ret urn to the picket lines.


With it s root equi-, meaning "equal," equivocate suggest s speaking on both sides of an issue at the same t ime. An equivocal answer is one that manages not to take a stand; an unequivocal answer, by contrast , is strong and clear. Polit icians are famous for equivocat ing, but equivocation is also t ypical of used-car salesmen, nervous wit nesses in a courtroom, and guys whose girlfriends ask them how commit t ed they are to a relat ionship.
 
==========irrevocable
Impossible to call back or retract .


?
 She had t old him she wasn't going to see him again, buthe couldn't believe her decision was irrevocable.


Irrevocable has a formal sound to itand is oft en used in legal cont ext s. Irrevocable trust s are trust funds that cannot be dissolved by the people who creat ed them (the other kind is a revocable trust ). An irrevocable credit is an absolut e obligat ion from a bank to provide credit to a cust omer. Irrevocable gift s, under U.S. tax law, are gift s thatare given by one living person to another and can't be reclaimed by the giver. But the word isn'talways legal; we've all had to make irrevocable decisions, decisions that commit us absolut ely to something.
 
==========advocat e
To speak in favor of.


?
 Our lawyer is advocat ing a suitagainst the stat e, but most of us would rather try some other approaches first .


The verb advocate may be followed by for ("advocat ed for bet t er roads," "advocat ed for merging the two school district s") or by a noun or gerund ("advocat ing an increase in the military budget ," "advocat ed closing the budget gap"). Butadvocate isn't only a verb: An advocate is someone who advocat es for you, or argues on your side. Originally, this was oft en a lawyer in court , and in Britain advocate is st ill a t erm for "lawyer."
 
==========vociferous Making noisy or emphat ic out cries.


?
 Whenever the referee at these soccer games makes a quest ionable call, you hear vociferous prot est s from half the parent s.


A vociferous group shout s loudly and insist ent ly, and they're usually not  t oo happy about something. So, for  example, we  oft en  hear  about  vociferous  crit ics, vociferous  demands, vociferous opponent s, or a vociferous minorit y. When a small group makes it self vociferous enough, everyone else may even start thinking it 's act ually a majorit y.
 
==========PHON is a Greek root meaning "sound," "voice," or "speech." It 's probably most familiar in the form of the English suffix -phone, in words that begin with a Greek or Latin rootas well. Thus, th e tele- in telephone means "far," the micro- in microphone means "small," the xylo- in xylophone means "wood," and so on.
 
==========phonics                    A method of t eaching beginners to read and pronounce words by learning the charact erist ic sounds of let t ers, let t er groups, and especially syllables.


?
 My son's school swit ched to phonics instruct ion several years ago, and reading achievement in the early grades has been improving.


In the field of beginning reading, there are two basic schools of thought in the U.S. t oday. One emphasizes "whole language" t eaching, which relies on t eaching a lot of reading; the other emphasizes phonics, t eaching how let t ers  and  syllables  correspond to sounds.  Phonics instruct ion may be especially difficult in English, since English has the most difficult spelling of any West ern language. Consider the various ways we creat e the f sound in cough, photo, and giraffe, or the sh sound in special, issue, vicious, and portion, or the k sound in tack, quite, and shellac, and how we pronounce the o in do, core, lock, and bone, or the ea in lead, ocean, idea, and early. Teaching phonics obviously isn'tan easy job, but it 's probably an important one.
 
==========phonet ic                        Relat ing to or represent ing the sounds of the spoken language.


?
 In almost every Spanish word the pronunciat ion is clear from the spelling, so the phonet ic part of learning Spanish isn't usually a big challenge.


The English alphabet is phonet ic-that is, the let t ers represent sounds. The Chinese alphabet , however, isn't phonet ic, since it s symbols represent ideas rather than sounds. But even in English, a let t er doesn'talways represent the same sound; the "a" in cat, father, and mate, for example, represent s three different sounds. Because of this, books about words oft en use specially creat ed phonet ic alphabet s in which each symbol stands for a single sound in order to represent pronunciat ions. So in this book, cat, father, and mate would be phonetically represent ed as           ,                  , and             .
 
==========polyphonic                          Referring to a st yle of music in which two or more melodies are sung or played against each other in harmony.


?
 Whenever he needed something calming, he would put on some quiet polyphonic music from the Renaissance and just let the voices waft over him.


Since poly- means "many" (see POLY), polyphonic music has "many voices." In polyphony, each parthas it s own melody, and they weave t ogether in a web that may become very dense; a famous piece by Thomas Tallis, composed around 1570, has 40 separat e voice part s. Polyphony reached it s height during the 16th cent ury with Italian madrigals and the sacred music of such composers as Tallis, Palestrina, and Byrd. Usually when we speak of polyphony we're talking about music of Bach's t ime and earlier; but the principles remain the same t oday, and songwrit ers such as the Beat les have somet imes used polyphony as well.
 
==========cacophony
   Harsh or unpleasant sound.


?
 In New York she was oft en dragged off by her boyfriend to downt own jazz concert s, where she struggled to make sense of what sounded like nothing but cacophony.


Cacophony employs the Greek prefix caco-, meaning "bad," but not everything we call cacophonous is necessarily bad. Grunge, thrash, hardcore, and goth music are unlist enable to some people and very popular to others. Open-air food market s may be marked by a cacophony of voices butalso by wonderful sight s and sounds. On the other hand, few people can really enjoy, for more than a few minut es, the cacophony of jackhammers, car horns, and truck engines thatassault s the cit y pedestrian on a hot day in August .

==========CUR, from the Latin verb curare, means basically "care for." Our verb cure comes from this root , as do manicure ("care of the hands") and pedicure ("care of the feet ").
 
==========curat ive                          Having to do with curing diseases.


?
 As soon as the ant ibiot ic ent ered his syst em, he imagined he could begin to feel it s curat ive effect s.


Medical researchers are finding curat ive substances in places that surprise them. Folklore has led to some "new" cures of old diseases, and nat ural substances never before tried have oft en proved effect ive. Quinine, which comes from a tree in the Andes, was the original drug for malaria; aspirin's main ingredient came from willow bark; and Taxol, a drug used in treat ing several cancers, was originally extract ed from the bark of a yew tree. The curat ive propert ies of these nat ural drugs are t oday duplicat ed in the laborat ory.
 
==========curat or                           Someone in charge of something where things are on exhibit , such as a collect ion, a museum, or a zoo.


?
 In recent decades, zoo curat ors have tried to make the animals' surroundings more and more like their nat ural homes.


In a good-sized art museum, each curat or is generally responsible for a single depart ment or collect ion: European paint ing, Asian sculpt ure, Nat ive American art , and so on. Curatorial dut ies include acquiring new art works, caring for and repairing object s already owned, discovering frauds and count erfeit s, lending art works to other museums, and mount ing exhibit ions of everything from Greek sculpt ure to 20th-cent ury clothing.
 
==========procure                        To get possession of; obtain.


?
 Invest igat ors were looking int o the quest ion of how the governor had procured such a huge loan at such a favorable rat e.


While procure has the general meaning of "obtain," it usually implies that some effort is required. It may also suggest get t ing something through a formal set of procedures. In many business offices, a part icular person is responsible for procuring supplies, and governmentagencies have formal procurement policies. When t eenagers use an older friend to procure the wrong kind of supplies for their part ies, they oft en risk get t ing int o trouble.
 
==========sinecure                   A job or posit ion requiring lit t le work but  usually providing some income.


?
 The job of Dean of St udent s atany college is no sinecure; the hours can be long and the work draining.


Sinecure contains the Latin word sine, "without ," and thus means "without care." In some countries, the government in power may be free to award sinecure posit ions to their valued support ers; in other countries, this would be regarded as corrupt ion. The posit ions occupied by Brit ish royalt y are called sinecures by some people, who claim they enjoy their enormous wealth in ret urn for nothing atall. But their many support ers point to the amount of public- service, charitable, and ceremonial work they perform, not to ment ion the effort they put int o promot ing Britain to the world.
 
==========PERI, in both Latin and Greek, means "around." A period is oft en a span of t ime that keeps coming around regularly, day aft er day or year aft er year. With a periscope, you can see around corners. Peristalsis is the process that moves food around the int est ines; without it , digest ion would grind to a halt .
 
==========perimet er
    The boundary or distance around a body or figure.


?
 In a medieval siege, an army would surround the perimet er of a cit y's high walls, denying the populat ion any food from out side as itassault ed the walls with catapult s and bat t ering rams.


The perimet er of a prison is ringed with high walls and wat cht owers, and the ent ire perimet er of Australia is bounded by wat er. In geometry, you may be asked to calculat e the perimet er of various geometrical shapes. In basket ball, the perimet er is the area beyond the free-throw circle; a "perimet er player" t ends to stay out side that circle. Try not to confuse this word with parameter, which usually means a rule or limit that controls what something is or how it can be done.
 
==========periodontal
     Concerning or affect ing the t issues around the t eeth.


?
 Years of bad living had filled his t eeth with cavit ies, but it was periodontal disease that finished them off.


In dent istry, cavit ies are important but they aren't the whole st ory; whathappens to your gums is every bitas vital to your dental health. When you don't floss regularly to keep plaque from forming on your t eeth and gums, the gums will slowly det eriorat e. Dent ist s called periodontists specialize in the treat ment of periodontal problems, and when the gums have broken down to the point where they can'thold the t eeth in place a periodont ist may need to provide dental implant s, a cost ly and unpleasant process. But even a periodont ist can't keep your gums healthy; that job is up to you.
 
==========peripat et ic (1) Having to do with walking. (2) Moving or traveling from place to place.


?
 She spenther early adult years as a peripat et ic musician, traveling from one engagement to another.


The philosopher Arist ot le had his school at the Lyceum gymnasium in Athens. The Lyceum may have resembled the Parthenon in being surrounded by a row of columns, or colonnade, which the Greeks would have called a peripatoi. Arist ot le was also said to have paced slowly while t eaching, and the Greek word for "pacing" was peripatos. And finally, peripatos meant simply "discussion."  What ever the source of  the word, Arist ot le and his followers became known  as  the Peripatetics, and  the  "pacing"  sense  led to peripatetic's English meaning of traveling or moving about . Johnny Appleseed is a good example of a peripat et ic soul, and peripat et ic execut ives and salespeople t oday stare int o their lapt op comput ers while endlessly flying from cit y to cit y.
 
==========peripheral                     (1) Having to do with the out er edges, especially of the field of vision. (2) Secondary or supplemental.


?
 Like most good fourth-grade t eachers, he had excellent peripheral vision, and the kids were convinced thathe had eyes in the back of his head.


Your peripheral vision is the out er area of your field of vision, where you can st ill det ect movementand shapes. It can be very valuable when, for instance, you're driving int o Chicago atrush hour, especially when swit ching  lanes. When people  call an  issue  in a  discussion peripheral, they mean that it 's not of primary importance, and they're probably suggest ing that everyone get back to the main t opic. Peripheral is now also a noun: comput er peripherals are the added component s-print ers, webcams, microphones, et c.-that increase a comput er's capacit ies.

==========SENS comes from the Latin noun sensus, meaning "feeling" or "sense." Sense it self obviously comes straight from the Latin. A sensation is something you sense. And if you're sensitive, you feel or sense things sharply, maybe even t oo sharply.
 
==========sensor                  A device that det ect s a physical quant it y (such as a movement or a beam of light ) and responds by transmit t ing a signal.


?
 The out door light s are triggered by a mot ion sensor that det ect s changes in infrared energy given off by moving human bodies.


Sensors are used t oday almost everywhere. Radar guns bounce microwaves off moving cars. A burglar alarm may use a phot osensor to det ect when a beam of lighthas been broken, or may use ultrasonic sound waves that bounce off moving object s. St ill other sensors may det ect pressure (baromet ers) or chemicals (Breathalyzers and smoke det ect ors). St ud finders, used by carpent ers to locat e wooden st uds under a wall, may employ magnet s or radar. Wired gloves, which relay informat ion about the posit ion of the fingers, are used in virt ual-realit y environment s. A cheap car alarm may be nothing buta shock sensor, in which a strong vibrat ion will cause two metal surfaces to come t ogether.
 
==========desensit ize
 To cause (someone or something) to react less to or be less affect ed by something.


?
 Even squeamish nursing st udent s report becoming desensit ized to the sight of blood aft er a few months of training.


Physical desensit izing is something that biologist s have long been aware of. Basic training in the armed forces tries to desensit ize new recruit s to pain. We can desensit ize ourselves to the summer heat by t urning off the air condit ioning, or become desensit ized to the cold by walking barefoot in the snow. But desensitize is more  oft en  used  when  talking  about  negat ive emot ions. Parent s worry that their children will be desensit ized to violence by playing video games. Soldiers may become desensit ized to death on the bat t lefield. Desensit izing may be nat ural and desirable under some circumstances, but maybe not so good in others.
 
==========extrasensory
   Not  act ing  or occurring  through  any  of  the  known senses.


?
 A kind of extrasensory capacit y seems to t ell some soldiers when danger is near.


Since extra means "out side, beyond" (see EXTRA), extrasensory means basically "beyond the senses." Extrasensory percept ion, or ESP, usually includes communicat ion bet ween minds involving no obvious contact  (telepathy), gaining informat ion about  something without  using the normal senses (clairvoyance), or predict ing the fut ure (precognition). According to polls, about  40% of Americans believe in ESP, and many of them have had personal experiences  that seem to prove it s exist ence. When someone jumps int o your mind months or years aft er you had last thought of him or her, and the next day you learn that the person has just died, it can be hard to convince yourself it was just coincidence. St ill, scient ific at t empt s to prove the exist ence of ESP have never been t erribly successful.
 
==========sensuous
      (1) Highly pleasing to the senses. (2) Relat ing to the senses.


?
 Part of whataudiences loved abouther was the delight she t ook in the sensuous pleasures of well-prepared food.


Sensuous and sensual are close in meaning but not ident ical, and sensuous was act ually coined by the poet John Milt on so thathe wouldn'thave to use sensual. Sensuous usually implies pleasing of the senses by art or similar means; great music, for example, can be a source of sensuous delight . Sensual, on the other hand, usually describes grat ificat ion of the senses or physical appet it es as an end in it self; thus we oft en think (perhaps unfairly) of wealthy Romans leading lives devot ed to sensual pleasure. You can see why the Puritan Milt on mighthave want ed another word.
 
==========SOPH come from the Greek words meaning "wise" and  "wisdom."  In  English  the  root somet imes appears in words where the wisdom is of the "wise guy" variet y, but in words such as philosophy we see it used more respect fully.
 
==========sophistry                           Cleverly decept ive reasoning or argument .


?
 For lawyers and polit icians, the pract ice of sophistry from t ime to t ime is almost unavoidable.


The Sophist s were a group of Greek t eachers of rhet oric and philosophy, famous during the 5th cent ury B.C., who moved from t own to t own offering their t eaching for a fee. The Sophist s originally represent ed a respectable school of philosophy, but some crit ics claimed that they tried to persuade by means of clever but misleading argument s. The philosopher Plat o wrot e negat ively about  them, and the comic dramat istarist ophanes made fun of them, showing them making ridiculously fine dist inct ions about word meanings. We get our modern meanings of sophist, sophistry, and the adject ive sophistical most ly from the opinions of these two men.
 
==========sophist icat ed
      (1)  Having  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the  ways  of societ y. (2) Highly complex or developed.


?
 In Woman of the Year, Katharine Hepburn plays a sophist icat ed journalist who can handle everything except Spencer Tracy.


A sophist icat ed argument is thorough and well-worked-out . A sat ellit e is a sophist icat ed piece of t echnology, complex and designed to accomplish difficult tasks. A sophist icat ed person, such as Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca, knows how to getaround in the world. But sophistication isn'talways admired. As you might guess, the word is closely relat ed to sophistry (see above), and it s original meanings weren't very posit ive, and st ill t oday many of us aren't sure we really like sophisticates.
 
==========sophomoric                Overly impressed  with  one's own  knowledge, but  in  fact undereducat ed and immat ure.


?
 We can't even list en to those sophomoric songs of his, with their at t empt s at profound wisdom that just demonstrat e how lit t le he knows about life.


Sophomoric seems to include the root s soph-, "wise," and moros, "fool" (seen in words such as moron), so the contrast bet ween wisdom and ignorance is builtright int o the word. Cambridge Universit y introduced the t erm sophomore for it s second-year st udent s in the 17th cent ury (though it 's no longer used in Britain), maybe to suggest thata sophomore has delusions of wisdom since he's no longer an ignorant freshman. In America t oday, sophomore is ambiguous since it can refer to either high school or college. But sophomoric should properly describe something-wit , behavior, argument s, et c.-that is at least trying to be sophisticated.
 
==========theosophy                     A set of t eachings about God and the world based on myst ical insight , especially t eachings founded on a blend of Buddhistand Hindu beliefs.


?
 He had experiment ed with a number of faiths, start ing with Buddhism and ending with a mixt ure of East ern and West ern thought that could best be called theosophy.


The word theosophy, combining root s meaning "God" and "wisdom," appeared back in the 17th cent ury, but the well-known religious movement by that name, under the leadership of the Russian Helena Blavat sky, appeared only around 1875. Blavat sky's theosophy combined element s of Plat o's philosophy with Christ ian, Buddhist , and Hindu thought (including reincarnat ion), in a way that she claimed had been divinely revealed to her. The Theosophical Societ y, founded in 1875 to promot e her beliefs, st ill exist s, as does the Anthroposophical Societ y, founded by her follower Rudolf St einer.

Achilles' heel
  A vulnerable point .


?
 By now his rival for the Senat e seathad discovered his Achilles' heel, the courtrecords of the t errible divorce he had gone through t en years earlier.


When the hero Achilles was an infant , his sea-nymph mother dipped him int o the river St yx to make him immortal. But since she held him by one heel, this spot did not t ouch the wat er and so remained mortal and vulnerable, and it was here thatachilles was event ually mortally wounded. Today, the t endon that stret ches up the calf from the heel is called the Achilles tendon. But the t erm Achilles' heel isn't used in medicine; inst ead, it 's only used with the general meaning "weak point "-for instance, to refer to a sect ion of a country's borders thataren't militarily prot ect ed, or to a Jeopardy cont estant 's ignorance in the Sport s cat egory.
 
==========arcadia
 A region or set t ing of rural pleasure and peacefulness.


?
 The Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania are a vacat ioner's arcadia.


Arcadia, a beaut iful rural area in Greece, became the favorit e set t ing for poems about ideal innocence unaffect ed by the passions of the larger world, beginning with the works of the Roman poet Virgil. There, shepherds play their  pipes and sigh with longing for flirtat ious nymphs; shepherdesses sing to their flocks; and goat -foot ed nat ure gods play in the fields and woods. Today, cit y dwellers who hope to ret ire to a country house oft en indulge in arcadian fantasies about whatrural life will be like.
 
==========Cassandra
  A person who predict s misfort une or disast er.


?
 They used to call him a Cassandra because he oft en expect ed the worst , buthis predict ions t ended to come true.


Cassandra, the daught er of King Priam of Troy, was one of those beaut iful young maidens with whom Apollo fell in love. He gave her the gift of prophecy in ret urn for the promise of her sexual favors, but  at the last minut e she refused him. Though he could not take back his gift , he angrily pronounced that no one would ever believe her predict ions; so when she prophesied the fall of her cit y to the Greeks and the death of it s heroes, she was laughed at by the Trojans. A modern-day Cassandra goes around predict ing gloom and doom-and may t urn out to be right some of the t ime.
 
==========cyclopean
    Huge or massive.


?
 They're imagining a new medical cent er on a cyclopean scale-a vast t en-block campus with thirt y high-rise buildings.


The Cyclopes of Greek mythology were huge, crude giant s, each with a single eye in the middle of his forehead. Odysseus and his men had a t errible encount er with a Cyclops, and escaped ut t er disast er only by stabbing a burning st ick int o the monst er's eye. The great st one walls at such ancient  sit es as Troy and Mycenae are called cyclopean because the st ones are so massive and the construct ion (which uses no cement ) is so expert that it was assumed that only a superhuman race such as the Cyclopes could have achieved such a feat .
 
==========draconian
      Extremely severe or cruel.


?
 The severe punishment s carried out in Saudi Arabia, including flogging for drunkenness, hand amputat ion for robbery, and beheading for drug trafficking, strike most of the world as draconian.


Draconian comes from the name of Draco, a leader of Athens in the 7th cent ury B.C. who in 621 B.C. produced it s first legal code. The punishment s he prescribed were extraordinarily harsh; almostanyone who couldn't pay his debt s became a slave, and even minor crimes were punishable by death. So severe were these penalt ies that it was said that the code was writ t en in blood. In the next cent ury, the wise leader Solon would revise all of Draco's code, retaining the death penalt y only for the crime of murder.
 
==========myrmidon A   loyal   follower,  especially one who execut es orders unquest ioningly.


?
 To an American, these soldiers were like myrmidons, all t oo eager to do the Beloved Leader's bidding.


In the Trojan War, the troops of the greathero Achilles were called Myrmidons. As bloodthirst y as wolves, they were the fiercest fight ers in all Greece. They were said to have come from the island of Aegina, where, aft er the island's ent ire populat ion had been killed by a plague, it was said to have been repopulat ed by Zeus, by t urning all the ant s in a great  anthill int o men. Because of their insect origin, the Myrmidons were blindly loyal to Achilles, so loyal that they would die withoutresist ing if ordered t o. The Trojans would not be the last fight ing force to believe thata t errifying opposing army was made up of men who were not quit e human.
 
==========nemesis
  A powerful, fright ening opponent or rival who is usually vict orious.


?
 During the 1970s and '80s, Japanese carmakers became the nemesis of the U.S. aut o industry.


The Greek goddess Nemesis doled outrewards for noble act s and vengeance for evil ones, but it 's only her vengeance thatanyone remembers. According to the Greeks, Nemesis did notalways punish an offender rightaway, but might waitas much as five generat ions to avenge a crime. Regardless, her cause was always justand her event ual vict ory was sure. But t oday a nemesis doesn'talways dispense just ice; a powerful drug lord may be the nemesis of  a Mexican police chief, for instance, justas Ernst Stavro Blofeld was James Bond's nemesis in three of Ian Fleming's novels.
 
==========Trojan horse                       Someone or something that works from within to weaken or defeat .


?
 Researchers are working on a kind of Trojan horse that will be welcomed int o the diseased cells and then destroy them from within.


Aft er besieging the walls of Troy for t en years, the Greeks builta huge, hollow wooden horse, secret ly filled it with armed warriors, and present ed it to the Trojans as a gift for the goddess Athena, and the Trojans t ook the horse inside the cit y's walls. That night , the armed Greeks swarmed outand capt ured and burned the cit y. A Trojan horse is thus anything that looks innocent but , once accept ed, has power to harm or destroy-for example, a comput er program that seems helpful but ends up corrupt ing or demolishing the comput er's soft ware.

PORT PEND PAN EXTRA PHOT LUC MOR/MORT TROPH WordsfromMythologyandHist ory
Quiz8-1 Quiz8-2 Quiz8-3 Quiz8-4 Quiz8-5 ReviewQuizzes8

PORT comes from the Latin verb portare, meaning "t o carry." Thus, something portable can be carried around. A porter carries your luggage, whether through a train stat ion or high int o the Himalayas. When we transport something, we have it carried from one place to another. And goods for exportare carried away to another country.
 
==========portage               The  carrying  of  boat s  or goods  overland  from one  body  of  wat er to another; also, a regular rout e for such carrying.


?
 The only portage on the whole canoe rout e would be the one around the great wat erfall on our second day.


Portage was borrowed from French back in the 15th cent ury to mean "carrying, transport ing" or "freight ," and ithas kept it s simple "carrying" sense to the present day. But it s first known use in it s "carrying of boat s" sense came in 1698, and the obstacle that the canoes couldn't be st eered over was none other than Niagara Falls. Though canoes are much light er t oday than they used to be, a long portage that includes a lot of camping gear can st ill t esta camper's strength.
 
==========port folio                        (1) A  flat  case  for  carrying  document s  or  art works. (2)  The invest ment s owned by a person or organizat ion.


?
 In those days, a graphic art ist who had recent ly moved to New York would just schlep his port folio around to every magazine office in the cit y.


Portfolio is part ly based on the Latin folium, meaning "leaf, sheet ." A port folio usually represent s a portable showcase of your talent s. Today act ual port folios are used less than they used to be by art ist s, since most commercial art ist s have a Web sit e dedicat ed to showing off their art . But portfolio in it s other common meaning is extremely common. Not so long ago, a broker would keep each of his or her client s' invest ment s in a separat e not ebook or port folio. Today the invest ment port folio, like an art ist 's port folio, usually takes the form of a Web page, even though everyone st ill uses the same old word.
 
==========comport                          (1) To be in agreement with. (2) To behave.


?
 This new evidence comport s with everything we know about whathappened that night .


With it s prefix com-, "with," the Latin word comportare meant "t o bring t ogether." So it 's easy to see how in English we could say thata college's policy comport s with stat e law, or thata visit to your parent s doesn't comport with your other weekend plans, or that your auntand uncle won't list en to anything on TV that doesn't comport with their prejudices. The "behave" sense of the word comes through French, and it s essent ial meaning is how a person "carries" him- or herself. So you may say, for instance, that your 17-year-old comport ed himself well (for once!) at the wedding recept ion, or thatan ambassador always comport s herself with dignit y-that is, her comportment is always dignified-or that your class comport ed it self in a way that was a credit to the school.
 
==========deport ment
     Manner of conduct ing oneself socially.


?
 At social event s she would constant ly sneak glances atalexandra, in quietadmirat ion of her elegantand graceful deport ment .


We've all seen pict ures of girls walking around balancing books on their heads in an effort to achieve the poise of a princess or a film star. Classes in deport ment were once a standard part of a young lady's upbringing, offered in all the girls' colleges; and you can st ill take privat e deport ment classes, where you'll learn about  post ure and body language, how to move, sit , stand, shake hands, dress, drink and eat , and much more. But deport ment isn'tall aboutrefined female grace. In fact , deport is oft en used as a synonym for comport, but usually in a posit ive way; thus, people are oft en said to deport themselves well, confident ly, with dignit y, like gent lemen or ladies, and so on.
 
==========PEND comes from the Latin verb pendere, meaning "t o hang" or "t o weigh." (In the Roman era, weighing something large oft en required hanging it from a hook on one side of the balance scales.) We find the root in English words like appendix,  referring to that  useless  and somet imes troublesome t ube thathangs from the int est ine, or that sect ion at the back of some books that might contain some useful addit ional informat ion.
 
==========pendant                          Something thathangs down, especially as an ornament .


?
 Around her neck she was wearing the ant ique French pendanthe had given her, with it s three rubies set in silver filigree.


Most pendant s are purely decorat ive. Buta pendant may also hold a pict ure or a lock of hair of a lover or a child. And, perhaps because they hang prot ect ively in front of the body and near the heart , pendant s have oft en had symbolic and magical purposes. Thus, a pendant may be a charm or amulet , or it s gems or metals may  be  felt to have  health-giving  propert ies. In archit ect ure, a pendant is an ornament thathangs down from a struct ure, but unlike a necklace pendant it 's usually solid and inflexible.
 
==========append                     To add as something extra.


?
 She appended to the memo a list of the specific it ems that the school was most in need of.


Append is a somewhat formal word. Lawyers, for example, oft en speak of appending it ems to other document s, and lawmakers frequent ly append small bills to big ones, hoping that everyone will be paying at t ent ion only to the main part of the big bill and won't not ice. When we append a small separat e sect ion to the end of a report or a book, we call itan appendix. But in the early years of e-mail, the words we decided on were attach and attachment, probably because appendixes are thought of as unimportant , whereas the at tachment is oft en the whole reason for sending an e-mail.
 
==========appendage                         (1) Something joined on to a larger or more important body or thing.
(2) A secondary body part , such as an arm or a leg.


?
 She oft en complained that she felt like a mere appendage of her husband when they socialized with his business part ners.


Appendix isn't the only noun that comes from append. Unlike appendix, appendage doesn't suggest the end of something, but simply something at tached. The word is oft en used in biology to refer to part s of an animal's body: an insect 's ant ennae, mouthpart s, or wings, for example. The appendages of some animals will grow  back aft er they've been removed; a salamander, for example, can regrow a finger, and the t iny sea squirt can regrow all it s appendages-and even it s brain.
 
==========suspend                     (1) To st op something, or to force someone to give up some right or posit ion, for a limit ed t ime. (2) To hang something so that it is free on all sides.


?
 The country has been suspended from the major trade organizat ions, and the effect s on it s economy are beginning to be felt .


When something is suspended, it is "lefthanging"; it is neither in full operat ion nor permanent ly ended. Suspense is a stat e of uncertaint y and maybe anxiet y. When we wat ch a play or movie, we enjoy experiencing a "suspension of disbelief"; that is, we allow ourselves to believe we're wat ching realit y, even though we aren't truly fooled.Suspension can also mean physical hanging; thus, in a suspension bridge, the roadway act ually hangs from huge cables. When some substance is "in suspension," it s part icles are "hanging" in another substance, mixed int o it but notact ually dissolved, like fine sand in wat er, or sea spray in the air at the seashore.

==========PAN comes from a Greek word meaning "all"; as an English prefix, it  can  also  mean "complet ely," "whole," or "general." A panoramic view is a complet e view in every direct ion. A pantheon is a t emple dedicat ed to all the gods of a religion. A pandemic out break of a disease may notaffect the ent ire human populat ion, but enough to produce a catastrophe.
 
==========panacea
   A remedy for all ills or difficult ies; cure-all.


?
 Educat ional reform is somet imes viewed as the panacea for all of societ y's problems.


Panacea comes from a Greek word meaning "all-healing," and Panacea was the goddess of healing. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, alchemist s who sought to concoct the "elixir of life" (which would give et ernal life) and the "philosopher's st one" (which would t urn ordinary metals int o gold) also labored to find the panacea. But no such medicine was ever found, justas no solut ion to all of a societ y's difficult ies has ever been found. Thus, panacea is almostalways used to crit icize the very idea of a t otal solut ion ("There's no panacea for the current problems plaguing Wall Street ").
 
==========pandemonium
            A wild uproar or commot ion.


?
 Pandemonium erupt ed in the stadium as the ball shot past the goalie int o the net .


In John Milt on's Paradise Lost, the fallen Satan has his heralds proclaim "A solemn Councel forthwith to be held / At Pandaemonium, the high Capital / Of Satan and his Peers." Milt on got  the name for his capital of hell, where Satan gathered t ogether all his demons, by linking pan with the Latin word daemonium, "evil spirit ." For lat er writ ers, pandemonium became a synonym for hell it self, since hell was then oft en seen as a place of constant noise and confusion, butalso for any wicked and lawless place. Nowadays it 's used to refer to the uproar it self rather than the place where it occurs.
 
==========pantheism
  A syst em of belief thatregards God as ident ical with the forces and laws of the universe.


?
 Most of her st udent s seemed to accepta vague kind of pantheism, withoutany real belief that God had ever appeared in human form.


Pantheistic ideas-and most important ly the belief that God is equal to the universe, it s physical mat t er, and the forces that govern it -are found in the ancient books of Hinduism, in the works of many Greek philosophers, and in lat er works of philosophy and religion over the cent uries. Much modern New Age spirit ualit y is pantheist ic. But most Christ ian thinkers reject pantheism because it makes God t oo impersonal, doesn'tallow for any difference bet ween the creat ion and the creat or, and doesn't seem to allow for humans to make meaningful moral choices.
 
==========panoply            (1) A magnificent or impressive array. (2) A display of all appropriat e accessory it ems.


?
 The full panoply of a royal coronat ion was a thrilling sight for the throngs of sidewalk onlookers and the millions of t elevision viewers.


The fully armed Greek soldier was an impressive sight , even if Greek armor never became as heavy as that of medieval knight s on horseback (who couldn't possibly have marched in such out fit s). Panoplia was  the Greek  word for the full suit of armor, and the English panoply originally likewise referred to the full suit of armor worn by a soldier or knight . Today panoply may refer to full ceremonial dress or lavish ceremonial decorat ion of any kind. And it can also refer to striking spectacle of almostany kind: the breathtaking panoply of aut umn foliage, or the st irring panoply of a military parade, for example.
 
==========EXTRA is Latin for "out side" or "beyond." So anything extraterrestrial or extragalactic takes place beyond the earth or the galaxy. Something extravagant, such as an extravaganza, goes way beyond the normal. And extra is nat urally a word it self, a short ening of extraordinary, "beyond the ordinary."
 
==========extradit e To deliver an accused criminal from one place to another where the trial will be held.


?
 Picked up by the Colorado police for burglary, he's being extradit ed to Mississippi to face trial for murder.


Extradit ion from one stat e to another is generally a straight forward process. But extradit ion may become more complicat ed when two countries are involved, even though most countries have  signed  treat ies stat ing  that  they will send  criminals to the  country where  they are want ed. Many  countries  oft en  won't  send  their own  cit izens to another country  for trial; countries that don't permit the death penalt y may notagree to send a suspect back to face such a penalt y; and most countries won't extradit e someone accused of polit ical crimes. When extradit ion seems unlikely, a country may act ually kidnap someone from another country, but  this is illegal and rare.
 
==========extrapolat e                           To ext end or project fact s or data int o an area not known in order to make assumpt ions or to predict fact s or trends.


?
 Economist s predict fut ure buying trends part ly by extrapolat ing from current economic data.


Scient ist s worry about the greenhouse effect because they have extrapolat ed the rat e of carbon-dioxide buildup and predict ed that it s effect on the at mosphere will become increasingly severe. On the basis of their extrapolations, they have urged government s and businesses to limit fact ory and aut omobile emissions. Not ice that it 's acceptable to speak of extrapolat ing exist ing data (t o produce new data), extrapolat ing from exist ing data (t o produce new data), or extrapolat ing new data (from exist ing data)-in other words, it isn't easy to use this word wrong.
 
==========extrovert                      A person mainly concerned with things out side him- or herself; a sociable and out going person.


?
 These part ies are always full of loud extrovert s, and I always find myself hiding in a corner with my drink.


Extrovert  (somet imes  spelled extravert)  means  basically  "t urned  out ward"-that  is, t oward things out side oneself. The word was coined by the eminent psychologist C. G. Jung in the early 20th cent ury. The opposit e personalit y t ype, in Jung's view, was the introvert. Extrovert s seem to be favored by societ ies such as ours, even though introvert s seem to be on average more mentally gift ed. Psychologist s have said that the only personalit y trait s that can be ident ified in newborn infant s are shyness and lack of shyness, which are fairly close t o-but notreally the same as-introversion and extroversion.
 
==========extraneous                           (1) Exist ing or coming from the out side. (2) Not forming an essent ial part ; irrelevant .


?
 Be sure your essays are well focused, with any discussion of extraneous t opics kept to a minimum.


Extraneous and strange both come from the same Latin word, extraneus, which  basically meant "ext ernal" or "coming from out side." But unlike strange, extraneous is a slight ly formal word, oft en used by scient ist s  and  social scient ist s. Researchers  always  try to eliminat e extraneous fact ors (or "extraneous variables") from their st udies. A researcher conduct ing a psychological t est , for example, would try to make sure that the people were t est ed under the same condit ions, and were properly divided according to gender, age, health, and so on.

==========PHOT comes from the Greek word for "light ." Photography uses light to creat e an image on film or paper, and a photocopy is an image made by using lightand t iny electrically charged ink part icles.
 
==========phot oelectric
    Involving an electrical effect  produced by the act ion of light or other radiat ion.


?
 They want ed to avoid the kind of smoke det ect or that uses radioact ive mat erials, so they've installed the phot oelectric kind inst ead.


Th e photoelectric effect occurs when light (or similar radiat ion  such  as  X-rays) falls  on  a mat erial such as a metal plat e  and  causes  it to emit  electrons. The  discovery  of  the phot oelectric effect led to important new theories about mat t er (and to a Nobel Prize for Albert Einst ein). Photoelectric cells, or photocells, are used in burglar-alarm light det ect ors and garage-door openers (both employ a beam of light that is broken when something moves across it ), and also to play soundtracks on movie film (where a light beam shines through the soundtrack encoded on the film and is "read" by the phot ocells).
 
==========phot ovoltaic
Involving the direct generat ion of electricit y when sunlight or other radiant energy falls on the boundary bet ween dissimilar substances (such as two different semiconduct ors).


?
 Phot ovoltaic t echnology is being applied to thin film that can produce as much energy as solar cells while using far less semiconduct ing mat erial.


The -voltaic part of photovoltaic comes from the name of Alessandro Volta, invent or of the electric bat t ery. Thus, unlike phot oelectric cells, which use electricit y for certain small tasks, phot ovoltaic (or PV) cells act ually  produce  electricit y.  Solar  cells,  the  standard  t ype  of phot ovoltaic cells (oft en called simply photocells), operat e without chemicals and with no moving part s to creat e energy direct ly from sunlight . Much research is now being done on creat ing an alt ernat ive t echnology-solar film, which could be st uck ont o almostany surface, or possibly even sprayed on.
 
==========phot on                    A t iny part icle or bundle of radiant energy.


?
 The idea that light consist s of phot ons is difficult unt il you begin to think of a ray of lightas being caused by a stream of t iny part icles.


It was Albert Einst ein who first theorized that the energy in a light beam exist s in small bit s or part icles, and scient ist s t oday know that light somet imes behaves like a wave (somewhat like sound or wat er) and somet imes like a stream of part icles. The energies of phot ons range from high-energy gamma rays and X-rays down to low-energy infrared and radio waves, though all travel at the same speed. The amazing power of lasers is the result of a concentrat ion of phot ons thathave been made to travel t ogether in order to hit their targetat the same t ime.
 
==========phot osynthesis
   The process by which green plant s use light to produce organic mat t er from carbon dioxide and wat er.


?
 Sagebrush survives in harsh climat es because it 's capable of carrying on phot osynthesis at very low t emperat ures.


The Greek root s of photosynthesis combine to produce the basic meaning "t o put t ogether with the help of light ." Phot osynthesis is what first produced oxygen in the at mosphere billions of years ago, and it 's st ill what keeps it there. Sunlight split s the wat er molecules (made of hydrogen and oxygen) held in a plant 's leaves and releases the oxygen in them int o the air. The left over hydrogen combines with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrat es, which the plant uses as food-as do any animals or humans who might eat the plant .
 
==========LUC comes from the Latin noun lux, "light ," and the verb lucere, "t o shine or glit t er." In ancientrome, Lucifer, meaning "Light -bearer," was the name given to the morning star, but the name was event ually transferred by Christ ians to Satan. This tradit ion, which dat es back to the period before Christ , said that Lucifer had once been among the angels buthad want ed to be the great light in the sky, and for his pride had been cast out of heaven and thus became the opponent of everything good.
 
==========lucid                   (1) Very clear and easy to understand. (2) Able to think clearly.


?
 On his last visithe had not iced thathis elderly mother hadn't seemed complet ely lucid.


Mental lucidity is easy to take for grant ed when we're young, though alcohol, drugs, and psychological instabilit y can confuse the mind atany age. We all hope to live to 100 with our mental abilit ies intact , which is ent irely possible; avoiding the condit ion called dement ia (which includes the well-known Alzheimer's disease) oft en involves a combinat ion of decent genes, physical and mental act ivit y, and a good diet . Writ ing lucidly, on the other hand, can take a lot of work atany age; you've probably had the experience of trying to read a set of instruct ions and wondering if the writ er even grew up speaking English.
 
==========elucidat e
 To clarify by explaining; explain.


?
 A good doct or should always be willing to elucidat e any medical jargon he or she uses.


The  basic  meaning  of elucidate  is  "t o  shed  light  on."  So  when  you  elucidat e, you  make transparent or clear something thathad been murky or confusing. Elucidation of a complex new health-care policy may be a challenge. Elucidat ion of the t erms of use for a credit card may be the last thing it s provider want s to do. The physicist Carl Sagan had  a  gift  for elucidat ing astronomical science to a large audience, his lucid explanat ions making clear how stars are born and die and how the universe may have begun.
 
==========lucubrat ion
       (1) Hard and difficult  st udy. (2) The product  of such st udy.


?
 Our professor admit t ed thathe wasn't looking forward to reading through any more of our lucubrat ions on novels that no one enjoyed.


Lucubration came to mean "hard st udy" because it originally meant st udy done by lamplight , and in a world without electric light s, such st udy was likely to be the kind of hard work that would only a dedicat ed st udent like Abe Lincoln would make a habit of. The word has a lit erary feel to it , and it 's oft en used with a t ouch of sarcasm.
 
==========translucent                           Part ly transparent ; allowing light to pass through without permit t ing object s beyond to be seen clearly.


?
 Archit ect s t oday oft en use industrial glass bricks in their home designs, because translucent walls admit daylight while guarding privacy.


With  it s  prefix trans-,  meaning  "through," translucent  describes  mat erial  that  light  shines through without making anything on the other side clearly visible, unlike a transparent mat erial. Frost ed glass, oft en used in bathroom windows, is translucent , as is stained glass. Red wine in a crystal goblet , when held before a candle in a dark corner of a quietrestaurant , usually proves to be translucentas well.

A mortuary is a place where dead bodies are kept unt il burial, and a postmortem examinat ion is one conduct ed on a recent ly dead body. The Latin phrase "Mement o mori" means "Remember that you must die"; so a memento mori is the name we give to a reminder of death; the skulls you can find carved on gravest ones in old cemet eries are examples.
 
==========mortalit y
   (1) The qualit y or stat e of being alive and therefore certain to die.
(2) The number of deaths that occur in a part icular t ime or place.


?
 Mortalit y rat es were highestamong those who those who lived closest to the plant .


Young people t end to assume they will never die; buta person's sense of his or her mortalit y generally increases year by year, and oft en increases great ly aft er a serious accident or illness. St ill, many people refuse to change behaviors that would improve their chances of living int o old age. Mortalit y rat es are calculat ed by governmentagencies, insurance companies, and medical researchers. Infant mortalit y rat es (the rat e at which infant s die in childbirth) provide a good indicat or of a country's overall health; in recent years, the rat es in countries like Iceland, Singapore, and Japan have been much bet t er than in the U.S.
 
==========moribund                  (1) In the process of dying or approaching death. (2) Inact ive or becoming out moded.


?
 Church at t endance in Britain has fallen in recent years, but no one would say the Anglican church is moribund.


Moribund is st ill somet imes used in it s original lit eral sense of "approaching death," but it 's much more oft en used to describe things. When the economy goes bad, we hear about moribund mills and fact ories and t owns; the economy it self may even be called moribund. Crit ics may speak of the moribund stat e of poetry, or lament the moribund record or newspaper industry.
 
==========amort ize                 To  pay  off  (something  such  as  a  mort gage)  by  making  small payment s over a period of t ime.


?
 For tax purposes, they chose to amort ize most of the business's start -up cost s over a three- year period.


Amortize is most common as a legal t erm, and many of us first come across it when we take outa mort gage or starta business. Financial officers and tax lawyers can choose how to legally amort ize various t ypes of business expenses, some of which may seem much bet t er than others. In mort gage amortization, much of what  you pay month by month is act ually int erest on the mort gage debt , especially at the beginning. So what does amort izing have to do with death?
 Basically, to amort ize a debt means to "kill" it slowly over t ime.
 
==========mort ify                    (1) To subdue or deaden (the body) especially by self-discipline or self- inflict ed pain. (2) To embarrass great ly.


?
 Our 14-year-old is mort ified whenever he sees us dancing, especially if any of his school friends are around.


Mortify once act ually meant "put to death," but no longer. It s "deaden" sense is most familiar to us in the phrase "mort ifying the flesh," which refers to a cust om once followed by devout Christ ians, who would starve themselves, deprive themselves of every comfort , and even whip themselves in order to subdue their bodily desires and punish themselves for their sins. But the most common use of mortify t oday is the "humiliat e" sense; it s connect ion with death is st ill apparent when we speak of "dying of embarrassment ."
 
==========TROPH comes from the Greek trophe, meaning "nourishment ." This part icular troph- root doesn't show up in many everyday English words (the troph- in words like trophy, apostrophe, and catastrophe has a different meaning), but inst ead t ends to appear in scient ific t erms.
 
==========atrophy                 (1) Gradual loss of muscle or flesh, usually because of disease or lack of use. (2) A decline or degenerat ion.


?
 Aft er a month in a hospital bed, my father required a round of physical therapy to deal with his muscular atrophy.


From it s lit eral Greek root s, atrophy would mean basically "lack of nourishment ." Although the English word doesn't usually imply any lack of food, italways refers to a wast ing away. Those who have been bedridden for a period of t ime will not ice that their muscles have atrophied. And muscular atrophy is a frequentresult of such diseases as cancer and AIDS. We also use atrophy in a much more general sense. Aft er being out of work a few years, you may find your work skills have atrophied; someone who's been living an isolat ed life may discover the same thing abouthis or her social skills; and a democracy can atrophy when it s cit izens cease to pay at t ent ion to how they're being governed.
 
==========hypertrophy                    (1)  Excessive   development   of   an   organ   or  part .  (2) Exaggerat ed growth or complexit y.


?
 Opponent s claimed that the Defense Depart ment , aft er years of being given t oo much money by the Congress, was now suffering from hypertrophy.


When the prefix hyper-, "above, beyond" (see HYPER), is joined to -trophy, we get the opposit e of atrophy. An organ or part becomes hypertrophic when it grows so extremely that it s funct ion is affect ed. Muscle hypertrophy is common in men who do strength training, and is oft en harmless; but extreme muscle hypertrophy generally involves taking st eroids, which can do great damage to the body. Hypertrophy of the heart sounds as if it might  be healthy, but inst ead it 's usually a bad sign. As the example sent ence shows, hypertrophy, like atrophy, can be used in nonmedical ways as well.
 
==========dystrophy              Any  of  several  disorders  involving  the  nerves  and  muscles, especially muscular dystrophy.


?
 The most common of the muscular dystrophies affect s only males, who rarely live to the age of 40.


Since the prefix dys- means "bad" or "difficult " (see DYS), dystrophy is always a negat ive t erm. Originally it meant "a condit ion caused by improper nutrit ion," but t oday the t erm is inst ead used for a variet y of other condit ions, part icularly condit ions that not iceably affect the muscles. Of the many t ypes of muscular dystrophy, the best known is Duchenne's, a t errible disease that strikes about one in 3,300 males and produces severe wast ing of the muscles. However, the muscular dystrophies generally affect many other organs and syst ems as well. And the other dystrophies, which t end to involve the eyes or hands, don't much resemble the muscular dystrophies.
 
==========eutrophicat ion
      The process by which a body of wat er becomes enriched in dissolved nutrient s.


?
 Local nat uralist s are get t ing  worried  about  the  increasing  eutrophicat ion  they've  been not icing in the lake.


Eutrophication, which comes from the Greek eutrophos, "well-nourished" (see EU), has become a major environmental problem. Nitrat es and phosphat es, especially from lawn fert ilizers, run off the land int o rivers and lakes, promot ing the growth of algae and other plant life, which take oxygen from the wat er, causing the death of fish and mollusks. Cow manure, agricult ural fert ilizer, det ergent s, and human wast e are oft en to blame as well. In the 1960s and '70s, the eutrophicat ion of Lake Erie advanced so extremely that it became known as the "dead lake." And many areas of the oceans worldwide-some more than 20,000 square miles in ext ent - have become "dead zones," where almost no life of any kind exist s.

==========Words from Mythology and History

aeolian  harp
 A  box-shaped  instrument  with  strings  that  produce musical sounds when the wind blows on them.


?
 Poet s have long been fascinat ed by the aeolian harp, the only instrument that produces music withouta human performer.


According to the ancient Greeks, Aeolus was the king or guardian of the winds. He lived in a cave with his many, many sons and daught ers, and sent forth what ever wind Zeus asked for. When Odysseus st opped there on his way home from Troy, he received a bag of winds to fill his sails. But while he was asleep, his men, thinking it contained treasure, opened the bag and released the raging winds, which blew their ships all the way back to their start ing point . An aeolian harp produces enchant ing harmonies when the wind passes over it . According to Homer, it was the god Hermes who invent ed the harp, by having the wind blow over the dried sinews at tached to the shell of a dead t ort oise.
 
==========cynosure
 (1) A guide. (2) A cent er of at t ent ion.


?
 Near the club's dance floor, a young rock star was hanging out , the cynosure of a small crowd of admirers.


In Greek kynosoura means "dog's tail," and in Latin Cynosura came to mean the const ellat ion Ursa Minor (Lit t le Bear)-what we usually call the Lit t le Dipper. The first star on the dog's or bear's "tail," or the dipper's "handle," is Polaris, the North Star, long used as a guide for seamen or travelers lost on a clear night , since, unlike the other stars, italways remains in the same posit ion in the northern sky, while the other const ellat ions (and even the rest of it s own const ellat ion) slowly revolve around it . Since Cynosura also came to mean the star it self, the English cynosure now may mean both "guide" and "cent er of at t ent ion."
 
==========laconic                        Using extremely few words.


?
 Act ion-film script s usually seem to call for laconic leading men who avoid conversat ion but get the job done.


Ancient Sparta was locat ed in the region of Greece known as Laconia, and the Greek word lakonikos could mean both "Laconian" and "Spartan." The disciplined and militarist ic Spartans, the finest warriors of their t ime, were known for put t ing up with extreme condit ions without complaint . So English writ ers who knew their ancienthist ory came to use laconic to describe the habit of saying few words. Today we can refer not only to a laconic person butalso to laconic wit , a laconic answer, or a laconic phrase-such as "Men of few words require few laws," ut t ered by a Spartan king.
 
==========mnemonic                          Having to do with the memory; assist ing the memory.


?
 Sales-training courses recommend various mnemonic devices as a way of remembering peoples' names.


The Greek word for memory is mnemosyne, and Mnemosyne was the goddess of memory and the mother of the Muses. So something thathelps the memory is a mnemonic aid, or simply a mnemonic. Such tradit ional mnemonic devices as "Every Good Boy Does Fine" (for the not es on the lines of a musical staff with a treble clef) or the "Thirt y days hath Sept ember" rhyme help to recall simple rules or complicat ed series that might otherwise slip away. (For extra credit , guess what "King Henry Died Drinking Chocolat e Milk" or "King Philip Could Only Find Green Socks" stands for.) Not ice that the first m isn't pronounced, unlike in other -mne- words such as amnesia and amnesty.
 
==========plat onic                    (1) Relat ing to the philosopher Plat o or his t eachings. (2) Involving a close relat ionship from which romance and sex are absent .


?
 The male and female leads in sit coms oft en keep their relat ionship plat onic for the first few seasons, butromance almostalways wins out in the end.


The philosopher Plat o present ed his theories in a series of dramat ic conversat ions bet ween Socrat es and other people, now called the "Plat onic dialogues." Among many other important concept s, he taught that everything here on earth is a pale imitat ion-like a shadow-of it s ideal form, and this ideal form is now oft en called the "plat onic form." But platonic is probably usually seen in the phrase "plat onic love." Because Socrat es (through Plat o) t eaches that the philosophical person should t urn his passion for a lover int o appreciat ion of beaut y and love of a higher power and of the universe, close but nonsexual friendship bet ween two people who might be thought to be romant ically at tract ed is t oday known as plat onic love or friendship.
 
==========sapphic                  (1) Lesbian. (2) Relat ing to a poet ic verse pat t ern associat ed with Sappho.


?
 The Roman poet s Cat ullus and Horace composed wonderful love poems in sapphic verse.


The poet Sappho wrot e poems of self-reflect ion butalso of passion, some of it direct ed to the women at t ending the school she conduct ed on the Greek island of Lesbos around 600 B.C. Even though most of the poems survive only as fragment s, they have been great ly admired for many cent uries. They were writ t en in an original rhythmical pat t ern, which has become known as sapphic verse. Lat er admirers, such as the Roman poet s Cat ullus and Horace, honored her by adopt ing the sapphic met er for their own poetry. Because of Sappho, the island of Lesbos also gave it s name to lesbianism, which writ ers oft en used to call sapphic love.
 
==========Socrat ic                        Having to do with the philosopher Socrat es or with his t eaching method, in which he syst emat ically quest ioned the st udent in conversat ion in order to draw forth truths.


?
 She challenges her st udent s by using the Socrat ic method, requiring them to think and respond constant ly in every class.


Socrat es lived and taught in Athens in the 5th cent ury B.C., but left no writ ings behind, so all we know of him comes through the works of his disciple Plat o, almostall of which claim to be account s of Socrat es' conversat ions with others. Today Socrat es is bestremembered for his method of t eaching by asking increasingly difficult quest ions, the so-called Socratic method. This generally involves the use of Socratic induction, a way of gradually  arriving  at generalizat ions through a process of quest ions and answers, and Socratic irony, in which the t eacher pret ends ignorance while quest ioning his st udent s skillfully to make them aware of their errors in understanding.
 
==========solecism
     (1) A grammat ical mistake in speaking or writ ing. (2) A blunder in et iquet t e or proper behavior.


?
 The poor boy commit t ed his first solecism immediat ely on ent ering by tracking mud over the Persian rug in the dining room.


In ancientasia Minor (now Turkey), there was a cit y called Soloi where the inhabitant s spoke Greek that was full of grammat ical errors. So errors in grammar, and lat er also small errors in formal social behavior, came to be known (at least by int ellect uals) as solecisms. The Brit ish magazine The Economist publishes a list of solecisms to be avoided in it s prose, including the use of "try and" when you mean "try t o," "hone in on" when you mean "home in on," and so forth. Social solecisms, such as ment ioning how inferior the wine is to someone who t urns out to be the host ess's sist er, are more commonly called by a French name, faux pas.

Quiz9-1 Quiz9-2 Quiz9-3 Quiz9-4 Quiz9-5 ReviewQuizzes9

HER comes from the Latin verb haerere, meaning "t o st ick." Another form of the verb produces the roothes-, seen in such words as adhesive, which means basically "st icky" or "st icking," and hesitate, which means more or less "st uck in one place."
 
==========adherent (1) Someone who follows a leader, a part y, or a profession. (2) One who believes in a part icular philosophy or religion.


?
 The general's adherent s heavily out numbered his opponent s and managed to shout them down repeat edly.


Justas tape adheres to paper, a person may adhere to a cause, a faith, or a belief. Thus, you may be an adherent  of Hinduism, an adherent  of environmentalism, or an adherent  of the Republican Part y. A plan for cut t ing taxes always at tract s adherent s easily, regardless of what  the cut s may result in.
 
==========cohere                  To hold t ogether firmly as part s of the same mass.


?
 His novels never really cohere; the chapt ers always seem like separat e short st ories.


When you finish writ ing a paper, you may feel that it coheres well, since it 's sharply focused and all the ideas seem to support each other. When all the soldiers in an army plat oon feel like buddies, the plat oon has become a cohesive unit . In science class you may learn the difference bet ween cohesion (the t endency of a chemical's molecules to st ick t ogether) and adhesion (the t endency of the molecules of two different substances to st ick t ogether). Wat er molecules t end to cohere, so wat er falls from the sky in drops, notas separat e molecules. But wat er molecules also adhere to molecules of other substances, so raindrops will oft en cling to the underside of a clothesline for a while before gravit y pulls them down.
 
==========incoherent                      (1) Unclear or difficult to understand. (2) Loosely organized or inconsist ent .


?
 The police had found him in an abandoned warehouse, and they report ed thathe was dirt y, hungry, and incoherent .


Incoherent is the opposit e of coherent, and both commonly refer to words and thought s. Justa s coherent means well ordered and clear, incoherent means disordered and hard to follow. Incoherence in speech may result from emot ional stress, especially anxiet y or anger. Incoherence in writ ing may simply result from poor planning; a t welve-page t erm paper that isn't writ t en unt il the night before it 's due will generally suffer from incoherence.
 
==========inherent                         Part of something by nat ure or habit .


?
 A guiding belief behind our Const it ut ion is that individuals have certain inherentright s that can't be taken away.


Inherent lit erally refers to something that is "st uck in" something else so firmly that they can't be separat ed. A plan may have an inherent flaw that will cause it to fail; a person may have inherent virt ues that everyone admires. Since the flaw and the virt ues can't be removed, the plan may simply have to be thrown outand the person will remain virt uous forever.
 
==========FUG comes from the Latin verb fugere, meaning "t o flee or escape." Thus, a refugee flees from some threat or danger, while a fugitive is usually fleeing from the law.
 
==========centrifugal
 Moving out ward from a cent er or central focus.


?
 Their favorit e carnival ride was the Round-up, in which centrifugal force flat t ened them against the out er wall of a rapidly spinning cage.


Centrifugal force is what keeps a string with a ball on the end taut when you whirl itaround. A centrifuge is a machine that uses centrifugal force. At the end of a washing machine's cycle, it becomes a weak and simple centrifuge as it whirls the wat er out of your clothes. Centrifuges hundreds of thousands of t imes as powerful are essent ial to nuclear t echnology and drug manufact uring. Part of an astronaut 's training occurs in a centrifuge that generat es force equal to several t imes the force of gravit y (about like a washing machine) to get them used to the forces they'll encount er in a real space mission.
 
==========refuge                Shelt er or prot ect ion from danger or distress, or a place that  provides shelt er or prot ect ion.


?
 Caught in a st orm by surprise, they t ook refuge in an abandoned barn.


The re- in refuge means basically "back" or "backward" rather than "again" (see RE-); thus, a refugee is someone who is "fleeing backward." Refuge t ends to appear with certain other words: you generally "seek refuge," "take refuge," or "find refuge." Religion may be a refuge from the woes of your life; a beaut iful park may be a refuge from the noise of the cit y; and your bedroom may be a refuge from the madness of your family.
 
==========fugue             A  musical  form  in  which  a  theme  is  echoed  and  imitat ed  by  voices  or instrument s that ent er one aft er another and int erweave as the piece proceeds.


?
 For his debut on the church's new organ, the organist chose a fugue by J. S. Bach.


Bach and Handel composed many fugues for harpsichord and organ in which the various part s (or voices) seem to flee from and chase each other in an intricat e dance. Each part , aft er ithas stat ed the theme or melody, apparent ly flees from the next part , which takes up the same theme and set s off in pursuit .

 The conservat ives' subt erfuge of funding a liberal third-part y candidat e in order to take vot es away from the main liberal candidat e almost worked that year.


With it s "flee" root , the Latin verb subterfugere meant "t o escape or avoid." Thus, a subt erfuge is a way of escaping blame, embarrassment , inconvenience-or even prison-by tricky means. The life of spies consist s of an endless series of subt erfuges. In the more everyday world, put t ing words like "heart -healthy" on junk-food packaging is a subt erfuge to trick unwary shoppers. And get t ing a friend to call aboutan "emergency" in order to get out of an evening engagement is about the oldest subt erfuge in the book.

 The astronomer, the biologist , and the philosopher all try in their own ways to make sense of the cosmos.


Cosmos oft en simply means "universe." But the word is generally used to suggestan orderly or harmonious universe, as it was originally used by Pythagoras in the 6th cent ury B.C. Thus, a religious myst ic may help put us in t ouch with the cosmos, and so may a physicist . The same is oft en true of the adject ive cosmic: Cosmic rays (really part icles rather than rays) bombard us from out er space, but cosmic quest ions come from human at t empt s to find order in the universe.
 
==========cosmology                         (1) A theory that describes the nat ure of the universe. (2) A branch of astronomy that deals with the origin and struct ure of the universe.


?
 New Age t eachers propose a cosmology quit e unlike the tradit ional Jewish, Christ ian, or Islamic ways of viewing the universe.


Mostreligions and cult ures include some kind of cosmology to explain the nat ure of the universe. In modern astronomy, the leading cosmology is st ill the Big Bang theory, which claims that the universe began with a huge explosion that sent mat t er and energy spreading out in all direct ions. One reason why fans wat ch Star Trek is for the various cosmologies depict ed in the show, including different concept ions of space, t ime, and the meaning of life.
 
==========microcosm
    Something (such as a place or an event ) that is seen as a small version of something much larger.


?
 The large hippie communes of the 1960s and '70s were microcosms of socialist syst ems, with most of socialism's advantages and disadvantages.


A troubled urban school can look like a microcosm of America's educat ional syst em. A company's problems may be so t ypical that they can representan ent ire small country's economic woes "in microcosm." Microcosm, and especially it s synonym microcosmos, are also somet imes used when talking about the microscopic world. The documentary film Microcosmos is devot ed to the remarkable insect life in an ordinary meadow on a single summer's day.
 
==========cosmopolitan
     (1)   Having   int ernat ional   sophist icat ion   and experience. (2) Made up of persons, element s, or influences from many different part s of the world.


?
 New York, like most cosmopolitan cit ies, offers a wonderful array of restaurant s feat uring foods from around the world.


Since cosmopolitan includes the root polit-, from the Greek word for "cit izen", someone who is cosmopolitan is a "cit izen of the world." She may be able to read the morning paper in Rio de Janeiro, at t end a lect ure in Madrid, and assistata refugee camp in Uganda with equal ease- and maybe all in the same week. And a cit y or a country that is cosmopolitan has aspect s and element s that come from various countries.
 
==========SCI comes from the Latin verb scire, "t o know" or "t o understand." The rootappears in such common words as science, which originally meant simply "knowledge," and conscience, meaning "moral knowledge." And to be conscious is to be in a stat e where you are able to know or understand.
 
==========conscient ious
    (1) Governed by moralit y; scrupulous. (2) Result ing from painstaking or exactat t ent ion.


?
 New employees should be especially conscient ious about t urning in all their assignment s on t ime.


Conscience and it s adject ive conscientious both come from a Latin verb meaning "t o be aware of guilt ." Conscientious indicat es extreme care, either in observing moral laws or in performing assigned dut ies. A conscient ious person is someone with a strong moral sense, who has feelings of guilt when he or she violat es it . A conscient ious worker has a sense of dut y that forces him or her to do a careful job. A conscient ious report shows painstaking work on the part of the writ er. And a conscientious objector is someone who, for reasons of conscience, refuses to fight in an army.
 
==========nescience                           Lack of knowledge or awareness: ignorance.


?
 About once every class period, my polit ical-science professor would angrily denounce the nescience of the American public.


This word, which means lit erally "non-knowledge," is only used by int ellect uals, and the same is true of it s adject ive, nescient. We all have heard the remarkable fact s: 40% of us believe thathumans and dinosaurs lived on earth at the same t ime; 49% believe that the President can ignore the Const it ut ion; 60% can't name the three branches of government ; 75% can't find Israel on a map; and so on. Is itany wonder we Americans are somet imes called nescient ?

 
==========prescient
Having or showing advance knowledge of what is going to happen.


?
 For years she had read the Wall Street Journal every morning, looking for prescient warnings about crashes, crises, and catastrophes on the horizon.


Being truly prescient would require supernat ural powers. But well-informed people may have such good judgmentas to appear prescient , and prescient is oft en used to mean "having good foresight ." Some newspaper columnist s may seem prescient in their predict ions, but we can'thelp suspect ing thatany apparent prescience is usually the result of leaks from people with inside knowledge.
 
==========unconscionable
           (1) Not guided by any moral sense; unscrupulous.
(2) Shockingly excessive, unreasonable, or unfair.


?
 When the fact s abouthow the cigaret t e industry had lied about it s pract ices for decades finally came out , mostamericans found the behavior unconscionable.


Something that can't be done in good conscience is unconscionable, and such act s can range from betraying a confidence to mass  murder. For  a  five-syllable  word, unconscionable  is act ually quit e common. This is part ly because it isn'talways used very seriously; so, for example, a crit ic is free to call a fat new book "an unconscionable wast e of trees." In law, an unconscionable contract is one that , even though it was signed by both part ies, is so ridiculous thata judge will just throw it out .

==========JUNCT comes from the Latin verb jungere, meaning "t o join." A junction is a place where roads or railways come t ogether. A conjunction is a word that joins two other words or groups of words: "this and that ," "t o be or not to be."
 
==========junct ure
(1) An important  point  in a process or act ivit y. (2) A place where things join: junct ion.


?
 The archit ect claims his design for the new Islamic Museum represent s a junct ure of Muslim and West ern cult ure.


The meaning of juncture can be ent irely physical; thus, you can speak of the junct ure of the t urnpike and Rout e 116, or the junct ure of the Shenandoah and Pot omac Rivers. But it more oft en means something nonphysical. This may be a moment in t ime, especially a moment when important event s are "crossing" ("At this crit ical junct ure, the President called t ogether his t op securit y advisers"). But juncture also oft en refers to the coming t ogether of two or more ideas, syst ems, st yles, or fields ("These churches seem to operat e at the junct ure of religion and patriot ism," "Her job is at the junct ure of product design and market ing," et c.).
 
==========adjunct                      Something joined or added to another thing of which it is nota part .


?
 All t echnical-school st udent s learn that classroom instruct ion can be a valuable adjunct to hands-on training.


With it s prefix, ad-, meaning "t o or t oward," adjunct implies that one thing is "joined t o" another. A car wash may be operat ed as an adjunct to a gas stat ion. An adjunct professor is one who's at tached to the college without being a full member of the salaried facult y. And anyone trying to expand his or her vocabulary will find that daily reading of a newspaper is a worthwhile adjunct to act ual vocabulary st udy.
 
==========disjunct ion
 A break, separat ion, or sharp difference bet ween two things.


?
 By now she realized there was a serious disjunct ion bet ween the account s of his personal life thathis two best friends were giving her.


A disjunct ion may be a mere lack of connect ion bet ween two things, or a large gulf. There's oft en a huge disjunct ion bet ween what people expect from comput ers and what they know about them, and the disjunct ion bet ween a star's public image and her act ual charact er may be justas big. We may speak of the disjunct ion bet ween science and moralit y, bet ween doing and t elling, or bet ween knowing and explaining. In recent years, disjunction seem to have been losing out to a newer synonym, the noun disconnect.
 
==========conjunct                          Bound t ogether; joined, unit ed.


?
 Polit ics and religion were conjunct in 18th-cent ury England, and the American colonist s were int ent on separat ing the t wo.


With it s prefix con-, meaning "with, t ogether," conjunct means basically "joined t ogether." A rather int ellect ual word, ithas special meanings in music (referring to a smooth melodic line that doesn't skip up or down) and astronomy (referring to two stars or planet s thatappear next to each other), but it s more general "bound t ogether" meaning is rarer. A conjunction is a word (part icularly and, or, or but) that joins t ogether words or groups of words, and an adverb that joins two clauses or sent ences (such as so, however, meanwhile, therefore, or also) is called a conjunctive adverb-or simply a conjunct.
 
==========PART, from the Latin word pars, meaning "part ," comes int o English most obviously in our word part. An apartment or compartment is part of a larger whole. The same is usually true of a particle.
 
==========bipart it e                         (1) Being in two part s. (2) Shared by t wo.


?
 The report is a bipart it e document , and all the important findings are in the second sect ion.


Usually a t echnical word, bipartite is common in medicine and biology. A bipart it e pat ella, for example, is a split kneecap; many people are born with them. Many creat ures have a bipart it e life cycle, living life in two very dist inct forms. As one example, the velella begins life as a creat ure that travels with thousands of others in the form of a kind of sailboat , blown across the ocean's surface with the wind; only lat er does each velella t urn int o a t iny jellyfish.
 
==========impart ial
  Fair and not biased; treat ing or affect ing all equally.


?
 Representat ives of labor and managementagreed to have the  mat t er  decided  by  an impart ial third part y.


To be "part ial t o" or "part ial t oward" someone or something is to be somewhat biased or prejudiced, which means thata person who is part ial really only sees part of the whole pict ure. To be impart ial is the opposit e. The Unit ed Nat ions sends impart ial observers to monit or elect ions in troubled countries. We hope judges and juries will be impart ial when they hand down verdict s. But grandparent s aren't expect ed to be impart ial when describing their new grandchild.
 
==========part iciple
     A word that is formed from a verb but used like an adject ive.


?
 In the phrase "the crying child,""crying" is a present part iciple; in "sat isfact ion guarant eed," "guarant eed" is a past part iciple.


English verbs can take several basic forms, which we call their principal parts: the infinit ive ("t o move," "t o speak," et c.), the past t ense ("moved," "spoke"), the past part iciple ("moved," "spoken"), and the present  part iciple ("moving," "speaking"). The part iciples are words that "take part " in two different word classes: that is, verb forms that can also act like adject ives ("the spoken word," "a moving experience"). A grammat ical error called a dangling participle occurs when a sent ence begins with a part iciple  that  doesn't  modify the  subject ; in  the sent ence "Climbing the mountain, the cabin came in view," for example, "climbing" is a dangling part iciple since it doesn't modify "cabin."
 
==========part isan
 (1) A person who is strongly devot ed to a part icular cause or group.
(2) A guerrilla fight er.


?
 Throughouthis career on the Supreme Court , he had been a forthright part isan of the cause of free speech.


A part isan is someone who support s one part or party. Somet imes the support takes the form of military act ion, as when guerrilla fight ers take on government forces. But partisan is act ually most oft en used as an adject ive, usually referring to support of a polit ical part y. so if you're accused of being  t oo  part isan, or  of  pract icing  part isan  polit ics, it  means  you're  mainly int erest ed in boost ing your own part y and at tacking the other one.

==========MIS  comes  from  the  Latin  verb mittere,  "t o  send."  A missile  is  something  sent  speeding through the air or wat er. And when your class is dismissed at the end of the day, you're senthome.
 
==========mission                        (1) A task that someone is given to do, especially a military task. (2) A task that someone considers an important dut y.


?
 She considers ither mission to prevent unwant ed puppies and kit t ens from being born.


Your own mission in life can be anything you pursue with almostreligious enthusiasm. People with a mission-whether it 's st opping drunk driving, keeping the t own's public areas clean, increasing local recycling, or building a communit y cent er-very oft en succeed in really changing things.
 
==========missionary                    A person undertaking a mission, and especially a religious missionary.


?
 North American missionaries have been working in Central America for decades, and you can find their churches in even the mostremot e jungle regions.


Beginning around 1540, an order of Catholic priest s known as the Jesuit s began to send it s members to many part s of the world to convert  peoples  who  believed  in  other gods to Christ ianit y. Wherever they went , the Catholic missionaries built central buildings  for their religious work, and the buildings themselves became known as missions; many 17th-cent ury missions in the American Westand Southwestare now preserved as museums. Their foes, the Prot estant s, soon began sending out their  own missionaries, and t oday Prot estant missionaries are probably far more numerous.
 
==========emissary
   Someone sent out to representanother; an agent .


?
 Now in his 70s, he had served over many years as a president ial emissary to many troubled regions of the world .


Like missionaries, emissaries are sent on missions. However, emissaries are more likely to be represent ing government s, polit ical leaders, and nonreligious inst it ut ions, and an emissary's mission is usually to negot iat e or to gather informat ion. So a president may send a trust ed emissary to a war-t orn region to discuss peace t erms. A company's CEO may send an emissary to check outanother company that they may be thinking of buying. And a polit ician may send outan emissary to persuade a wealthy individual to become a support er.
 
==========transmission
    (1) The act  or process of sending something from one point to another, especially sending electrical signals to a radio, t elevision, comput er, et c. (2) The gears by which the power is passed from the engine to the axle in a mot or vehicle.


?
 Even in the Middle Ages, transmission of news of a ruler's death across the Asian cont inent could be accomplished by sun reflect ors within 24 hours.


Since trans- means "across" (see TRANS), it 's nothard to see the meaning of transmission. Disease transmission occurs when an infect ion passes from one living thing to another. TV signal transmission can be int errupt ed by tree leaves, including moving leaves and branches during a st orm. Your car's transmission transmits the engine's power to the axle, changing the gears to keep the engine working with maximum efficiency at various speeds.
 
==========PEL comes from the Latin verb pellere, meaning "t o move or drive." So a propeller moves a small airplane forward. And if you dispel someone's fears, you "drive them away."
 
==========compel              (1) To  force  (someone) to do  something. (2) To  make  (something) happen.


?
 Aft er ret urning from the lect ure, they felt compelled to contribut e to one of the refugee relief agencies.


The prefix com- act s as a strengthener in this word; thus, to compel is to drive powerfully, or force. So you may feel compelled to speak to a friend abouthis drinking, or compelled to reveal a secret in order to prevent something from happening. A compulsion is usually a powerful inner urge; a compulsive shopper or a compulsive gambler usually can'thold ont o money for long. You might not want to do something unless there's a compelling reason; however, a compelling film is simply one that seems serious and important .
 
==========expel                    (1) To drive or force out . (2) To force to leave, usually by official act ion.


?
 For repeat edly ignoring importantagreement s over several years, the two countries were event ually expelled from the trade organizat ion.


To expel is to drive out , and it s usual noun is expulsion. Expel is similar to eject, but expel suggest s pushing out while eject suggest s throwing out . Also, eject ing may only be t emporary: the player eject ed from a game may be back t omorrow, but the st udent expelled from school is probably out forever.
 
==========impel                   To urge or drive forward by strong moral force.


?
 As the meet ing wore on withoutany real progress being made, she felt impelled to stand and speak.


Impel is very similar in meaning to compel, and oft en a perfect synonym, though it t ends to suggest even more strongly an inner drive to do something and a great er urgency to act , especially for moral reasons. But when impel takes it s noun and adject ive forms, it changes slight ly. So an impulse-such as "impulse buying," when you suddenly see something cool and know you've got to have it -oft en isn't based on anything very serious. And impulsive behavior in general, such as blurt ing out something st upid on the spur of the moment , is the kind of thing you're supposed to get over when you grow up.
 
==========repel                (1) To keep (something) out or away. (2) To drive back.


?
 Her son, knowing how she was repelled by rat s and snakes, had start ed keeping them in his bedroom.


Since re- can mean not just "again" butalso "back" (see RE-), repel means "drive back." Repel has two common adject ive forms; thus, a repellent or repulsive odor may drive us int o the other room. It s main noun form is repulsion. Magnet s exhibit both at tract ion and repulsion, and the goal of an armed defense is the repulsion of an enemy; but we generally use repulsion to mean "strong dislike." In recent years, repulse has been increasingly used as a synonym for repel ("That guy repulses me").

==========Words from Mythology

arachnid                        A member of the class Arachnida, which principally includes animals with four pairs of legs and no ant ennae, such as spiders, scorpions, mit es, and t icks.


?
 His int erest in arachnids began when, as a child, he would wat ch spiders build their gorgeous webs in the corners of the porch.


The Greek word for "spider" is arachne, and, according to Greek mythology, the original arachnid was a girl named Arachne. A marvelous weaver, she made the mistake of claiming she was bet t er ather craft than the goddess Athena. In a cont est bet ween the t wo, she angered the goddess by weaving a remarkable tapestry showing the gods behaving badly. As punishment , Athena changed Arachne int o a spider, fat ed to spend her life weaving. With their eight legs, arachnids are easily dist inguished from the six-legged insect s, on which they feed by inject ing digest ing juices and then sucking up the liquefied remains.
 
==========calliope                        A musical instrument similar to an organ in which whist les are sounded by st eam or compressed air.


?
 The t own's old calliope, with it s unmistakable sound, summoned them to the fair every summer.


To the ancient Greeks, the Muses were nine goddesses, each of whom was the spirit of one or more of the art s and sciences. Calliope was the Muse of heroic or epic poetry, who inspired poet s to writ e such epics as the Iliad and the Odyssey. Since the lengthy epics were generally sung from beginning to end, she was responsible for a great deal of musical recit ing. But she wouldn't necessarily have approved  of  having  her  name  used  for  the  hoot ing  organlike instrument that was invent ed in America around 1855. Calliopes gave a fest ive air to the great showboat s that float ed up and down the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers giving theatrical performances; the loudest could supposedly be heard eight miles away, at tract ing cust omers from all around. Today they are most ly heard on merry-go-rounds and at circuses.
 
==========dryad                  A wood nymph.


?
 The ancient Greeks' love of trees can be seen in their belief that every tree contained a dryad, which died when the tree was cut .


The t erm dryad comes from the Greek word for "oak tree." As the Greeks saw it , every tree (not only oaks) had a spirit . The best known of the dryads was Daphne. The beaut iful daught er of a river god, she was desired by the god Apollo; as he was about to capt ure her, she prayed to her father to save her, and he transformed her int o a laurel tree. In her honor, Apollo commanded that the poet who won the highest prize every year be crowned with a laurel wreath. The Greeks' respect for trees  unfort unat ely failed to keep Greece's  forest s from shrinking great ly over the cent uries, and those thatremain produce lit t le wood of good qualit y.
 
==========fauna Animal life, especially  the  animals  that  live  nat urally  in  a  given  area  or environment .


?
 The larger fauna of the count y include coyot es, black bear, deer, moose, wild t urkey, hawks, and vult ures.


Faunus and Fauna were the Roman woodland god and goddess for whom animals were a part icular concern. Faunus was the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Pan, and like Pan, he had goat s' legs. Their goat -legged helpers, called fauns, were known for their love of pleasure and mischief. The fauna of a cont inentare oft en very similar across a broad east -west band; from north to south, however, they may vary great ly.
 
==========flora Plant life, especially the flowering plant s that live nat urally in a specific area or environment .


?
 Scient ist s are busily ident ifying the flora of the Amazon rain forest before the rapid expansion of commercial int erest s consumes it .


Flora means "flower" in Latin, and Flora was the Roman goddess of spring and flowering plant s, especially wildflowers and plant s notraised for food. She was shown as a beaut iful young woman in a long, flowing dress with flowers in her hair, strewing flowers over the earth. English preserves her name in such words as floral, floret, and flourish. A region's flora may range from  t iny violet s to t owering trees. The common phrase "flora and fauna" covers justabout every visible living thing.
 
==========herculean
 (1) Extremely  strong. (2) Extremely  ext ensive, int ense, or difficult .


?
 Accomplishing all the things he promised during the president ial campaign will be a herculean task.


The hero Hercules, son of the god Zeus by a human mother, was famous for his superhuman strength. To pacify the wrath of the god Apollo, he was forced to perform t welve enormously difficult tasks, or "labors." These ranged from descending int o the underworld to bring back the t errifying dog that guarded it s entrance to destroying the many-headed monst er called the Hydra. Any job or task that 's extremely difficult or calls for enormous strength is therefore called herculean.
 
==========Pandora's box
        A source of many troubles.


?
 In a thundering speech, he predict ed that , if the bill was passed, the new policy would open a Pandora's box of economic problems.


The god Prometheus st ole fire from  heaven to give to the  human  race, which  originally consist ed only of men. To punish humanit y, the other gods creat ed the first woman, the beaut iful Pandora. As a gift , Zeus gave her a box, which she was t old never to open. However, as soon as he was out of sight she t ook off the lid, and out swarmed all the troubles of the world, never to be recapt ured. Only Hope was left in the box, st uck under the lid. Anything that looks ordinary but may produce unpredictable harmful result s can thus be called a Pandora's box.
 
==========Scylla and Charybdis

?
 Doct ors and pat ient s who need to calculat e the ideal dosage of the medicat ion, knowing how it can trigger a different dangerous condit ion, oft en feel caught bet ween Scylla and Charybdis.


The Strait of Messina is the narrow passage bet ween the island of Sicily and the "t oe" of Italy's "boot ." In Greek mythology, two monst ers hovered on either side of the strait . Scylla, a female monst er with six snake-like heads, each with point ed t eeth, barked like a dog from the rocks on the Italian side. Charybdis, on the Sicilian side, caused a whirlpool by swallowing the wat ers of the sea three t imes a day. When Odysseus at t empt ed to sail bet ween them, he encount ered disast er on both sides. Being caught bet ween Scylla and Charybdis is a lot like being bet ween a rock and a hard place.

PUT LOG TERR MAR PATH PEN/PUN MATR/MATER AQU WordsfromMythology
Quiz10-1 Quiz10-2 Quiz10-3 Quiz10-4 Quiz10-5 ReviewQuizzes10

PUT comes from the Latin verb putare, meaning "t o think, consider, or believe." So, for example, a reputation is what others think of you. But when the root shows up in such words as compute, dispute, and deputy, it s meaning is harder to trace.
 
==========reput ed                           Believed to be a certain way by popular opinion.


?
 The 15th-cent ury prince Vlad the Impaler is reput ed to have inspired the charact er Dracula, though in fact , evil though Vlad was, Dracula's creat or only borrowed his nickname.


Reputed is used constant ly t oday by report ers, and almostalways to describe suspect ed criminals-"the reput ed mobst er," "the reput ed drug kingpin," "the reput ed gang leader," et c. But the word shouldn't be left to journalist s; your elderly aunt may, for instance, be reput ed to have made a large fort une in oil, or to have had four husbands who all died myst eriously. Reputed is easy to confuse with reputable, and they used to mean the same thing-that is, "having a good reputat ion"-but  it 's become rare to hear reputed used with that  meaning t oday.
 
==========disreput e
 Loss or lack of good reputat ion; disgrace.


?
 The family had fallen int o disreput e aft er the convict ion and imprisonment of his father and uncle.


A reputation can be easy to lose, and someone who is no longer respectable may event ually find he's become genuinely disreputable-the kind of person thatalmost no one want s to be seen with. Disreput e isn't only for individuals: A company may fall int o disreput e as a result of news st ories about it s product s' defect s; drug scandals have brought ent ire sport s int o disreput e; and a scient ific theory may fall int o disreput e as a result of new discoveries.
 
==========imput e                      To at tribut e.


?
 The Brit ish imput ed  mot ives  of  piracy to American  ships  trying to prevent  them  from int erfering with American trade during the War of 1812.


Imput ing something to someone (or something) usually means observing something invisible in that person (or thing). We may imput e meaning to a play or novel, or to a casual remark by a friend, that was never int ended. Many of us like to imput e bad mot ives to others, while always regarding our own mot ives as pure. In tax law, imput ed income is something that isn'tact ual money but mightas well be-for example, the free use of a car lent to you by your employer.
 
==========putat ive                          Generally supposed; assumed to exist .


?
 To strengthen the case for the defense, a putat ive expert t ook the stand.


Putative is almostalways used to express doubt or skept icism abouta common belief. Thus, Tintagel Cast le in Cornwall, a pict uresque ruin, is the putat ive fortress of the medieval King Arthur. The resident s of New York Cit y are putatively chic, neurot ic, rude, and dangerous. And cable TV is full of putat ive expert s, who oft en t urn out not to have much knowledge of the subject s they're talking about .
 
==========LOG, from the Greek word logos, meaning "word," "speech," or "reason," is found part icularly in English words that end in -logy and -logue. The ending -logy oft en means "the st udy of"; so, for instance, biology is the st udy of life, and anthropology is the st udy of humans. And -logue usually indicat es a t ype of discussion; thus, dialogue is conversat ion bet ween two people or groups, and an epilogue is an author's last words on a subject . But except ions aren'thard to find.
 
==========physiology
  (1) A branch of biology dealing with the processes and act ivit ies by which living things, t issues, and cells funct ion. (2) The life processes and act ivit ies of a living thing or any of it s part s.


?
 For st udent s planning to go to medical school, the universit y's most popular major is Human Physiology.


The Latin root physio- generally means "physical," so human physiology deals with justabout everything that keeps us alive and working, and other physiology specialt ies do the same for other animals and for plant s. To do anything serious in the field of health, you've obviously got to know how the body's organs and cells funct ion normally. Physiology used to be considered separat ely from anat omy, which focuses on the body's struct ures; however, it 's now known that struct ure and funct ion can't easily be separat ed in a scient ific way, so "anat omy and physiology" are oft en spoken of in the same breath.
 
==========methodology
     A set of methods or rules followed in a science or field.


?
 Some researchers claimed that Dr. Keller's methodology was sloppy and had led to unreliable conclusions.


The methodology employed in an experiment is essent ial to it s success, and bad methodology has spoiled thousands of research project s. So whenever a piece of research is published in a scient ific or  medical  journal, the  researchers  always  carefully  describe  their  methodology; otherwise, other scient ist s couldn't possibly judge the qualit y of what they've done.
 
==========ideology
  The set of ideas and beliefs of a group or polit ical part y.


?
 By the t ime she t urned 19, she realized she no longer believed in her family's polit ical ideology.


The root ideo-, as you might guess, means "idea." Ideas and theories abouthuman behavior can always be carried t oo far, since such behavior is very hard to pin down. So ideological thinkers-people who come up with large theories abouthow the world works and try to explain everything (and maybe even predict the fut ure) according to those  theories-are almostalways disappoint ed, sooner or lat er, to find that it doesn'treally work out . A person int ensely  devot ed to a  set  of  polit ical  ideas  or  theories  can  be  called  an ideologue-a translat ion of the French idologue, a word act ually coined by Napoleon as a label for those polit ical thinkers full of ideas he had no use for.
 
==========cardiology
 The st udy of the heartand it s act ion and diseases.


?
 Aft er his heartat tack, he  act ually boughthimself a  cardiology t ext book and  setabout learning everything he could abouthis unreliable organ.


The root card- (closely relat ed to cord-see CORD) shows up in many heart -relat ed words. Cardiologists frequent ly find themselves st udying cardiograms, the chart s of heartact ivit y, made by machines called cardiographs. Heartat tacks, and deaths caused by them, have both declined as a result of bet t er medical emergency procedures, cholest erol-lowering drugs, and a decline in smoking. But the fact ors likely to act ually improve hearthealth, such as bet t er diet s and more cardiovascular exercise (exercise, such as running, that improves the heartand blood vessels), haven't made any progress atall. So we should all be prepared to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (an emergency procedure done on someone whose hearthas st opped, to get the heartand lungs working again).

==========TERR comes from the Latin terra, "earth." A territory is a large expanse of land. Terra firma is Latin for "firm ground" as opposed to the swaying seas. A terrace is a leveled area, oft en one creat ed for farming on a sloping hill. And the French word for potat o, pomme de terre, means lit erally "apple of the earth."
 
==========part erre               (1) A decorat ive garden with paths bet ween the beds of plant s. (2) The back area of the ground floor of a theat er, oft en under the balcony.


?
 The cit y's park boast s a beaut iful part erre with many variet ies of roses.


Parterre comes to English by way of French, where it means "on the ground." And in the early years of the theat er, the part erre was truly on the ground. In Shakespeare's day, an English theat er's part erre was the cheap standing-room area right in front of the stage, normally filled with rowdy spectat ors. The original idea of the French part erre garden, with it s carefully designed plot s and walkways, was to presentan art ist ic pat t ern when seen from above-from a balcony, a raised t errace, or the t op of an out door staircase. English gardeners responded with garden designs that tried to make their viewers  half-forget  that  they  were  seeing something creat ed by humans rather than untamed nat ure it self.
 
==========subt erranean
      Underground.


?
 In Carlsbad Caverns Nat ional Park there is an ast onishing subt erranean chamber over half a mile long.


A t unnel is a subt erranean road or pathway, and a subway is a subt erranean railway. The subt erranean vault s at Fort Knox hold billions of dollars of gold reserves. Subt erranean reservoirs called aquifers are tapped  for  wat er;  in  places  where  the  pressure  on  the subt erranean wat er is great enough, a hole drilled in the ground will bring it bubbling to the surface.
 
==========t errarium
 An  enclosure, usually transparent , with  a  layer of  dirt  in  the bot t om in which plant s and somet imes small animals are kept indoors.


?
 When no one was wat ching, they dropped their snake in the fifth-grade t errarium, and then wait ed in the hall to hear the screams.


The t urt le exhibitata zoo is oft en in the form of a t errarium, as are some of the exhibit s ata plant conservat ory. In an ant t errarium, elementary-school st udent s wat ch the ant s dig their net work of t unnels as if no one were wat ching. Terrariums try to creat e condit ions as close as possible to a nat ural habitat . A covered t errarium can oft en sustain it self for months on the moist ure trapped inside. But creat ing a good t errarium requires careful control not only of humidit y butalso of t emperat ure, as well as good vent ilat ion; the light ing should include the full spectrum of sunlightas well as a day-nightregulat or.
 
==========t errestrial                      (1) Having to do  with  Earth  or it s inhabitant s. (2) Living  or growing on land inst ead of in wat er or air.


?
 The roadrunner, although a largely t errestrial bird, can take flight for short periods when necessary.


Everything on or having to do with Earth can be called t errestrial. Mercury, Venus, and Mars are oft en called the t errestrial planet s, since they are rocky balls somewhat like Earth rather than great globes of gas like Jupit er, Sat urn, Uranus, and Nept une. Something extraterrestrial comes from beyond the earth and it s at mosphere; the word can be used to describe anything "out of this world," from moon rocks to met eors. Turning to the second sense of terrestrial, animals are oft en divided int o the t errestrial (land-living) and the aquat ic (wat er-living). And somet imes t errestrial animals are contrast ed with arboreal animals, those that live in trees.
 
==========MAR, from the Latin word mare, meaning "sea," brings it s salt y tang to several English words. A submarine is an undersea ship. Marine means basically "relat ing to the sea," so when the Cont inental Marines were established back in 1775, their job was to provide on-board securit y on naval ships; but they immediat ely began to be used on land as well, and the marines have cont inued to operat e on both land and sea ever since.
 
==========marina                        A dock or harbor where pleasure boat s can be moored securely, oft en with facilit ies offering supplies or repairs.


?
 The coast of Florida has marinas all along it for the use of anything from flimsy sailboat s to enormous yacht s.


Marina comes straight from Latin, where it means simply "of the sea." Ata modern marina, sailors can acquire what ever they need for their next excursion, or they can t ie up their boat s unt il the next weekend  comes  along. Some  even  imitat e  John  D. MacDonald's  famous det ect ive hero Travis McGee, who lives on his boat in Miami and rarely leaves the marina.
 
==========aquamarine                          (1) A transparent blue or blue-green gem. (2) A pale blue or greenish blue that is the color of clear seawat er in sunlight .


?
 Many of the houses on the Italian Riviera  are  paint ed  aquamarine to mat ch  the Medit erranean.


Aqua marina is Latin for "seawat er," so when a lovely blue-green form of the semiprecious gem known as beryl was given an English name several cent uries ago, aquamarine seemed appropriat e. Aquamarine is the ideal color that most of us carry around in our heads when we imagine the wat ers that lap the shores of the Greek and Caribbean islands on a sunny day. But even the Medit erranean and the Caribbean can take on lot s of other colors depending on weather condit ions.
 
==========mariner                           A seaman or sailor.


?
 When he signed on as a mariner, the young Ishmael never suspect ed that the ship would be pursuing a great whit e whale.


In Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner, an old seaman t ells of how, by shoot ing a friendly albatross, he had brought st orms and disast er to his ship, and how as punishment  his shipmat es hung the great seabird around the mariner's neck and made him wear it unt il itrot t ed. The word mariner has occasionally been used to mean simply "explorer," as in the famous Mariner spaceflight s in the 1960s and '70s, the first to fly close to Mars, Venus, and Mercury.
 
==========marit ime                  (1) Bordering on or having to do with the sea. (2) Having to do with navigat ion or commerce on the sea.


?
 As a result of the ocean, Canada's Marit ime Provinces-New Brunswick, Nova Scot ia, and Prince Edward Island-have a lat e spring buta mild wint er.


The marit ime countries of Port ugal and England produced many seafaring explorers during the 16th and 17th cent uries, many of whom sailed under the flags of other countries. Sailing for the Spanish, Ferdinand Magellan captained the ship that was the first to circle the world, chart ing many new marit ime rout es as it went . Henry Hudson, funded by the Dut ch, sailed up what we call t oday the Hudson River, claiming the marit ime area that now includes New York Cit y for the Netherlands.

==========PATH comes from the Greek word pathos, which means "feeling" or "suffering." So a pathetic sight moves us to pit y, and a sympathetic friend "feels with" you when you yourself are suffering.
 
==========pathos                  (1) An element in life or drama that produces sympathet ic pit y. (2) An emot ion of sympathet ic pit y.


?
 The pathos of the blind child beggars she had seen in India could st ill keep her awake at night .


Pathos comes  direct ly  from Greek. According to Arist ot le, the persuasive power of public speaking relies on three element s: the speaker's authorit y, the logic of the speech, and the speech's pathos. Arist ot le claims that pathos is the appeal to the audience's sense of rightand wrong, and that it is this (unlike authorit y and logic) that moves the audience's emot ions. Today we usually speak of pathos as an element in fict ion, film, drama, music, or even paint ing, or the real-life pathos of a sit uat ion or personalit y. Since pathos is closely relat ed to pathetic, it 's not surprising that , like pathetic, pathos may occasionally be used a bit sarcast ically.
 
==========apathet ic
    (1) Showing or feeling lit t le or no emot ion. (2) Having no int erest .


?
 His apathet ic response to the vict ory bewildered his friends.


Apathy, or lack of emot ion, is central to Albert Camus's famous novel The Stranger, in which the main charact er's indifference t oward almost everything, including his  mother's  death, result s in his imprisonment . We feel lit t le sympathy for him, and may even feel antipathy, or dislike. The American vot er is oft en called apathet ic; of all the industrial democracies, only in America does half the adult populat ion fail to vot e in major elect ions. As you can see, apathetic isn't the opposit e of pathetic, even though the a- that it begins with means "not " or "without ."
 
==========empathy The feeling of, or the abilit y to feel, the emot ions and sensat ions of another.


?
 Her mat ernal empathy was so strong that  she oft en seemed to be living her son's life emot ionally.


In the 19th cent ury, Charles Dickens count ed on producing an empathetic response in his readers strong enough to make them buy the next  newspaper installment  of  each novel. Today, when reading a novel such as A Tale of Two Cities, only the mosthard-heart ed reader could  fail to feel  empathy  for  Sidney  Cart on  as  he  approaches  the  guillot ine. One  who empathizes suffers along with the one who feels the sensat ions direct ly. Empathy is similar to sympathy, but empathy usually suggest s stronger, more inst inct ive feeling. So a person who feels sympathy, or pit y, for vict ims of a war in Asia may feel empathy for a close friend going  through the much smaller disast er of a divorce.
 
==========t elepathic
   Involving apparent  communicat ion from one mind to another without speech or signs.


?
 Aft er t en years of marriage, their communicat ion is virt ually t elepathic, and each always seems to know what the other is thinking.


Since tele- means "distant " (see TELE), you can see how telepathy means basically "feeling communicat ed from a distance." The word was coined around 1880, when odd psychic phenomena were being widely discussed by people hoping thatresearchers might  find  a scient ific basis for what they believed they themselves were experiencing. Today, when people  talk about extrasensory percept ion, or ESP, t elepathy is usually what they're talking about . In recent years, the not ion of memes-ideas that might somehow physically fly from brain to brain so that people all over the world mighthave the same idea atabout  the same t ime withoutany obvious communicat ion-has been widely discussed. Even though scient ist s haven't been able to establish the exist ence of t elepathy, about 30% of Americans cont inue to believe in it .
 
==========PEN/PUN comes from the Latin words poena, "penalt y," and punire, "t o punish." A penalty is, of course, a punishment.
 
==========penal                   Having to do with punishment or penalt ies, or inst it ut ions where punishment is given.


?
 The classic novels Les Misrables and The Count of Monte Cristo portray the  t errible condit ions in French penal inst it ut ions in the 19th cent ury.


A stat e or country's penal code defines it s crimes and describes it s punishment s. During the 18th and 19th cent uries, many countries established penal colonies, where criminals were sentas punishment . Oft en these were unbearably severe; but it was to such colonies that some of Australia's and the Unit ed Stat es' early whit e inhabitant s came, and the convict s provided labor for the European set t lement of these lands.
 
==========impunit y
      Freedom from punishment , harm, or loss.


?
 Under the flag of truce, the soldiers crossed the field with impunit y.


Impunit y is prot ect ion from punishment , justas immunit y is prot ect ion from disease. Tom Sawyer, in Mark Twain's novel, broke his Aunt Polly's rules with near impunit y because he could usually sweet -talk her int o forgiving him; if that failed, he had enjoyed himself so much he didn't care what punishment she gave him.
 
==========penance                 An act  of self-punishment  or religious devot ion to show sorrow or regret for sin or wrongdoing.


?
 In the Middle Ages bands of pilgrims would trudge to distantholy sit es as penance for their sins.


Penance as a form of apology for a mistake can be either voluntary or ordered by someone else. Many religions include penance among the ways in which believers can show repentance or regret for a misdeed. The Christ ian season of Lent , 40 days long, is tradit ionally a t ime for doing penance.
 
==========punit ive
Giving, involving, or aiming at punishment .


?
 The least popular t eachers are usually the ones with punit ive at t it udes, those who seem to enjoy punishing more than t eaching.


Punitive is an important word in the law. When you sue a person or company for having wronged you in some way, you normally ask for something of value equal to what you were deprived of by the other part y. But when the defendanthas done something part icularly bad, you may also ask for punitive damages, money over and above the act ual cost of the harm done, int ended to t each the defendanta lesson. Punit ive damages are fairly rare, but when they're act ually grant ed they may be as much as four t imes the size of the basic damages.

==========MATR/MATER comes from the Greek and Latin words for "mother." A matron is a mat ure woman with children. And matrimony is  marriage  it self, the  tradit ional  first  st ep  t oward motherhood.
 
==========mat ernit y
     The stat e of being a mother; motherhood.


?
 It 's quit e possible that the Mona Lisa is a portrait of mat ernit y, and that the paint ing marks the recent birth of her child Andrea.


Maternity is used as both a noun and an adject ive. Maternity benefits are benefit s specially provided by employers for women having babies, and usually include maternity leave, t ime off work. With mat ernit y come maternal feelings, which are shown by all species of warm-blooded animals as well as a few rept iles such as crocodiles and alligat ors.
 
==========matriarch
  A woman who controls a family, group, or government .


?
 Every Augustall the grown children and their families are summoned to the estat e by the matriarch.


A matriarchy is a social unit governed by a woman or group of women. It isn't certain thata true matriarchal societ y has ever exist ed, so matriarchy is usually treat ed as an imaginat ive concept . But there are societ ies in which relat edness through women rather than men is stressed, and element s of matriarchy may be stronger in certain societ ies than they are in most of the West ern world. And most of us can point to families in which a woman has become the dominant figure, or grande dame, or matriarch.
 
==========matrilineal
  Based on or tracing the family through the mother.


?
 Many of the peoples of Ghana in Africa trace their family through matrilineal connect ions.


A person's lineage is his or her line of ancest ors. So matrilineal means basically "through the mother's line," justas patrilineal means "through the father's line." Matrilineality is an important concept in anthropology; among other things, it usually det ermines who will inherit propert y on a person's death. Though families that follow the European model take the father's name and are therefore patrilineal, matrilineal societ ies have exist ed around the world, including among various American Indian tribes.
 
==========matrix                 (1) Something (such as a sit uat ion or a set  of  condit ions) in which something else develops or forms. (2) Something shaped like a pat t ern of lines and spaces.


?
 The country's polit ical matrix is so complex that no one who hasn't lived there could possibly understand it .


In ancientrome, a matrix was a female animal kept for breeding, or a plant (somet imes called a "parent plant " or "mother plant ") whose seeds were used for producing other plant s. In English the word has taken on many relat ed meanings. Mathemat icians use it for a rectangular organizat ion of numbers or symbols that can be used to make various calculat ions; geologist s use it for the soil or rock in which a fossil is discovered, like a baby in the womb. And matrix was a good choice as the name of the realit y in which all humans find themselves living in a famous series of science-fict ion films.
 
==========AQU comes from aqua, the Latin word for "wat er." We keep pet fish in an aquarium athome or visit larger sea animals in a building with that name. Wat er sport s such as swimming, canoeing, and sailing are somet imes called aquatics. In Scandinavia there's a popular drink called aquavit, the name coming from the Latin aqua vitae, "wat er of life"-though inst ead of wat er it most ly consist s of alcohol.
 
==========aquacult ure
The farming of plant s and animals (such as kelp, fish, and shellfish) that live in the wat er.


?
 The farming of oyst ers by the Romans was an early form of aquacult ure thathas cont inued to the present day.


For most of the modern hist ory of aquacult ure, only cost ly fish and shellfish like salmon and shrimp were harvest ed. But  new  t echnologies  are  allowing  cheaper  and  more  efficient cult ivat ion of fish for food, and such common fish as cod are now being farmed. Seaweeds and other algae are also being grown-for food (most ly in Asia), cat t le feed, fert ilizer, and experimentally as a source of energy. Aquacult ure is now the world's fast est -growing form of food product ion.
 
==========aquanaut                 A scuba diver who lives and works both inside and out side an underwat er shelt er for an ext ended t ime.


?
 Each scient istat the laborat ory spent two weeks a year as an aquanaut living in the deep- sea stat ion.


Aquanaut combines aqua with the Greek nautes, meaning "sailor." Like astronautand aeronaut, the word may remind you of those mythical Greek heroes known as the Argonaut s, who sailed with Jason on his ship, the Argo, in quest of the Golden Fleece. Various underwat er habitat s for aquanaut s, such as Conshelf, SEALAB, and MarineLab, have capt ured the public imaginat ion since the 1960s.
 
==========aqueduct (1) A pipe or channel for wat er. (2) A bridgelike struct ure for carrying wat er over a valley.


?
 Roman aqueduct s were built throughout the empire, and their spectacular arches can st ill be seen in Greece, France, Spain, and North Africa.


Based  part y on  the  Latin ducere, meaning  "lead"  or "conduct "  (see DUC/DUCT), the word aqueduct named an ancient civil-engineering marvel. You may have seen phot os of the greatarches of ancientaqueduct s spanning valleys in countries throughout the old Roman Empire, pract ical pipelines thatare also regarded as works of t imeless beaut y. From the 20th cent ury, the 242-mile Colorado River Aqueduct , the 336-mile Central Arizona Project , and the 444-mile California  Aqueduct  are  considered  wonders  of  American  engineering,  but  they  are  notrenowned  for  their  beaut y.  Most  aqueduct s  t oday  either  are  riverlike  channels  or  run underground, perhaps appearing simply as a long mound.
 
==========aquifer                           A layer of rock, sand, or gravel that can absorb and hold wat er.


?
 Cit ies withoutaccess to a nearby lake or river mustrely on underground aquifers to meet their wat er needs.


The vast butrelat ively shallow Ogallala Aquifer lies beneath the Great Plains, under port ions of eight stat es. It s thickness ranges from a few feet to more than a thousand feet . The Ogallala yields about 30 percent of the nat ion's groundwat er used for irrigat ion in agricult ure, and provides drinking wat er for most of the people within the area. But for many years more wat er has been extract ed from the Ogallala than has been ret urned, and the sit uat ion t oday is of great concern.

==========Words from Mythology

cereal       (1) A plant that produces grain that can be eat en as food, or the grain it produces. (2) The food made from grain.


?
 Rice is the main food cereal of Asia, whereas wheatand corn are the main food cereals of the West .


The Roman goddess Ceres, the equivalent of the Greek Demet er, was a calm goddess who didn't take part in the quarrels of the other gods. Her part icular responsibilit y was the food- giving plant s, and for thatreason the food grains came to carry her name. Cereals of the ancientromans included wheat , barley, spelt , oat s, and millet -but not corn (maize), which was a cereal of the Americas.
 
==========Junoesque
Having mat ure, poised, and dignified beaut y.


?
 In 1876, as a cent ennial gift , the French sent to America a massive stat ue of a robed Junoesque figure represent ing Libert y, to be erect ed in New York Harbor.


Juno was the wife of Jupit er, the chief of the Roman gods. As the firstamong goddesses, her power gave her part icular dignit y; and as goddess of women and marriage, she was a mat ure matron. But such younger goddesses as Diana, goddess of the hunt , perhaps came closer to t oday's ideals of slim and athlet ic female beaut y.
 
==========mart ial                         Having to do with war and military life.


?
 The st irring, mart ial strains of "The Brit ish Grenadiers" echoed down the snowy street justas dawn was breaking.


Mars was the Roman god of war and one of the patron gods of Rome it self. He was responsible for everything military, from warriors to weapons to marching music. Thus, martial arts are skills of combatand self-defense also pract iced as sport . When martial law is declared, a country's armed forces take over the funct ions of the police. And a court-martial is a military court or trial.
 
==========Promethean
  New or creat ive in a daring way.


?
 Beginning in the 1950s, the lit t le Asian countries of South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore began to display a Promethean energy that would become one of the marvels of the modern world.


Prometheus was a Titan, a generat ion older than Zeus. When Zeus overthrew his own father Cronus and seized power, Prometheus fought on the side of the gods and againsthis fellow Titans. But when Zeus lat er want ed to destroy the race of humans, Prometheus saved them by st ealing fire for them from the gods. He also taught them how to writ e, farm, build houses, read the stars and weather, cure themselves when sick, and tame animals-in short , all the art s and skills that make humans unique. So invent ive was he thatanything of great creat ivit y and originalit y can st ill be called Promethean. But Prometheus had taken a t errible  risk; enraged by his disobedience, Zeus had him chained to a rocky cliff, where for many long cent uries an eagle daily t ore athis liver.
 
==========Sisyphean
   Endless and difficult , involving many disappoint ment s.


?
 Aft er t went y years, many researchers had begun to think that defeat ing the virus was a Sisyphean task that would never succeed.


Reput edly the cleverest man on earth, King Sisyphus of Corinth tricked the gods int o bringing him back to life aft er he had died. For this they punished him by sending him back to the underworld, where he must et ernally roll a huge rock up a long, st eep hill, only to wat ch itroll back to where  he  start ed. Something  Sisyphean  demands  the  same  kind  of  unending, thankless, and ult imat ely unsuccessful effort s.
 
==========t itanic                      Having great size, strength, or power; colossal.


?
 The t itanic floods of 1993 destroyed whole t owns on the Mississippi River.


In Greek mythology, the  Titans were  the  generat ion  of giant creat ors that produced  the younger, stronger, cleverer gods, who soon overpowered and replaced them (see Promethean above). In 1911 the largest ship thathad ever been built was christ ened the Titanic for it s unmat ched size and strength. But the name may have proved unlucky; on it s maiden voyage in 1912 a massive iceberg ripped a fatal hole in the great ship, and it sank in the icy wat ers off Newfoundland.
 
==========Trit on                  (1) A being with a human upper body and the lower body of a fish; a merman.
(2) Any of various large mollusks with a heavy, conical shell.


?
 In one corner of the paint ing, a robust Trit on emerges from the sea with his conch to announce the coming of the radiant queen.


Trit on was originally the son of the sea god Poseidon (or Nept une). A guardian of the fish and other creat ures of the sea, he is usually shown as heart y, muscular, and cheerful. Like his father, he oft en carries a trident (three-pronged fork) and may ride in a chariot drawn by seahorses. Blowing on his conch shell, he creat es the roar of the ocean. As a decorat ive image, Trit ons are simply the male version of mermaids. The handsome seashells that bear their name are the very conchs on which they blow. Trit on has also given his name to the planet Nept une's largest moon.
 
==========vulcanize                       To treat crude or synthet ic rubber or plast ic so that it becomes elast ic and strong and resist s decay.


?
 The nat ive islanders had even discovered how to vulcanize the rubber from the local trees in a primit ive way.


The Roman god Vulcan (the Greek Hephaest us) was in charge of fire and the skills that use fire, especially blacksmithing. When Charles Goodyear almostaccidentally discovered how to vulcanize rubber in 1839, he revolut ionized the rubber industry. He called his process vulcanization because it used fire to heata mix of rubber and sulfur. Vulcanized rubber was soon being used for shoes and other product s, and in the Civil War balloons made of this new, stronger rubber carried Union spies over the Confederat e armies. The mat erial's importance increased great ly over the years, and t oday vulcanized rubber remains in use for aut omobile t ires and numerous other product s.

CANT LINGU SPIR VER TURB VOLU/VOLV FAC LUM WordsfromMythologyandHist ory
Quiz11-1 Quiz11-2 Quiz11-3 Quiz11-4 Quiz11-5 ReviewQuizzes11

CANT, from the Latin verb cantare, meaning "sing," produces several words that come direct ly from Latin. But some others came to English by way of French, which added an h to the root , giving us such words as chantand chantey.
 
==========cantata                        A musical composit ion, part icularly a religious work from the 17th or 18th cent ury, for one or more voices accompanied by instrument s.


?
 Composers of the 18th cent ury composed sacred cantatas by the dozen, and Bach's friend
G. P. Telemann act ually wrot e over a thousand.


A cantata is sung, unlike a sonata, which is played on instrument s only. The most famous cantatas are by Johann Sebast ian Bach, who wrot e the music for about 200 religious cantatas, using hymns and new religious poems as his t ext s. His cantatas consist ed of several different sect ions for different  voices-solos, duet s, and choruses. Some of his nonreligious cantatas have been performed like mini-operas.
 
==========incantat ion
 (1) A use of spells or verbal charms spoken or sung as part of a rit ual of magic. (2) A formula of words used in, or as if in, such a rit ual.


?
 He repeat ed the words slowly over and over like an incantat ion.


Incantation comes direct ly from the Latin word incantare, "enchant ." Incantare it self has cantare as a root , which reminds us that magic and rit ual have always been associat ed with chant ing and music. Incantat ions have oft en been in strange languages; "Abracadabra" is a not -so-serious version of an incantat ion.
 
==========cant or           An official of a Jewish synagogue who sings or chant s the music of the services and leads the congregat ion in prayer.


?
 The congregat ion wait ed for the cant or to begin the prayers before joining in.


The cant or is, aft er the rabbi, the most important figure in a Jewish worship service. A cant or not only must possess an excellent singing voice butalso must know by heart long passages of Hebrew. Cant ors such as Jan Peerce and Richard Tucker became int ernat ional opera stars. The comedian and singer Edward Israel Iskowit z renamed himself Eddie Cant or for his original profession and became enormously popular on stage, screen, radio, and t elevision for over 40 years.
 
==========descant                           An addit ional melody sung above the principal melody.


?
 The soprano added a soaring descant to the final chorus thatheld the list eners spellbound.


The prefix des-, meaning "t wo" or "apart ," indicat es that the descant is a "second song" apart from the main melody. In popular songs a descant will oft en be sung at the very end to produce a thrilling climax.
 
==========LINGU comes from the Latin word that means both "t ongue" and "language," and in English t oday tongue can st ill mean "language" (as in "her nat ive t ongue"). Our expression "slip of the t ongue" is justa translat ion of the Latin phrase lapsus linguae. The root even shows up in a slangy-sounding word like lingo. And since lingu- changed to langu- in French, our word language is relat ed as well.
 
==========linguist ics
    The st udy of human speech.


?
 The new speechwrit er, who had majored in linguist ics, was soon put t ing his knowledge of the decept ive tricks of language to good use.


Any analysis of language, including 8th-grade grammar, can be called linguist ics. As recent ly as 200 years ago, ordinary grammar was about the only kind of linguist ics there was. Today a linguist may be a person who learns foreign languages, but the t erm usually refers to people who devot e themselves to analyzing the struct ure of language. Many linguist s concentrat e on the hist ory of a language; others st udy the way children learn to speak; others analyze the sounds of a language-and st ill others just st udy English grammar, a subject so big that you could easily spend your ent ire life on it .
 
==========mult ilingual
  Using or able to use several languages.


?
 She soon discovered thathe was truly mult ilingual, fluent in not only the German and Polish he had grown up speaking but in English and Arabic as well.


The root s of multilingual come from Latin (see MULTI). If you happen to prefer Greek, use the synonym polyglot, in which poly- has the same meaning as multi-, and -glot means the same thing  as -lingual. The best  way to become mult ilingual is probably to be born in a bilingual (t wo-language) household; learning those first two seems to give the mind the kind of exercise that makes lat er language-learning easy.
 
==========lingua franca
   A language used as a common or commercial language among peoples who speak different languages.


?
 That first evening in Tokyo, she heard English being spoken at the next table, and realized it was serving as a lingua franca for a part y of Korean and Japanese businessmen.


In the Middle Ages, the Arabs of  the east ern Medit erranean referred to all Europeans as Franks (the name of the tribe that once occupied the land we call France). Since there was plent y of Arab-European trade, the traders in the Medit erranean port s event ually developed a  trading language combining Italian, Arabic, and other languages, which almost everyone could more or less understand, and it became known as the "Frankish language," or lingua franca. Some languages act ually succeed in becoming lingua francas without changing much. So, when the Roman empire became vastand might y, Latin became the important lingua franca; and ata meet ing bet ween Japanese and Viet namese businesspeople t oday, English may well be the only language spoken.
 
==========linguine
 A narrow, flat pasta.


?
 As a t est of her client s' table manners, she would serve them challenging dishes and wat ch to see how gracefully they could handle chopst icks or deal with long, slithery linguine.


The modern language closest to Latin is Italian, and the Italian word linguine means lit erally "lit t le t ongues." Linguine is only one of the t ypes of pasta whose names describes their shapes. Others include spaghetti ("lit t le strings"), fettuccine ("lit t le ribbons"), penne ("lit t le quills"), orzo ("barley"), farfalle ("but t erflies"), vermicelli ("lit t le worms"), capellini ("lit t le hairs"), fusilli ("lit t le spindles"), and radiatori ("lit t le radiat ors"). If you're thinking about learning Italian, you could make a good start by just visit ing an Italian restaurant .

==========SPIR comes from the Latin words meaning "breath" and "breathe." When we inspire others- that is, give them inspiration-it 's as though we're breathing new energy and imaginat ion int o them. When you expire, or die, you "breathe out "  your soul in your last breath. A license, membership, credit card, or free offer may also expire, ata t ime indicat ed by it s expiration dat e.
 
==========spirit ed                           Full of energy or courage; very lively or det ermined.


?
 The t eam put up a spirit ed defense, but they were doomed from the start .


You may see spirited used to describe a conversat ion, a debat e, a horse, or a campaign. And it oft en shows up in such words as high-spirited ("bold and energet ic"), mean-spirited ("spit eful"), and public-spirited ("generous to a communit y"), all of which reflect the original meaning of spirit, a not ion much like "soul" or "personalit y."
 
==========dispirit ing
  Causing a loss of hope or enthusiasm.


?
 It was t erribly dispirit ing for them to lose yetanother game, and he had to reassure his daught er that she'd act ually done a great job as goalie.


Lot s of things can be dispirit ing: a bad job int erview, an awful film, a relat ionship going sour. Maybe for thatreason, dispiriting has lot s of synonyms: discouraging, disheartening, demoralizing, depressing, et c.
 
==========respirat or                    (1) A device  worn  over the  nose  and  mouth to filt er out dangerous substances from the air. (2) A device for maintaining art ificial respirat ion.


?
 His lungs had been t erribly damaged by decades of heavy smoking, and he'd been living on a respirat or for the last year.


Respiration means simply "breathing." We usually come across the word in artificial respiration, the lifesaving t echnique in which you force air int o the lungs of someone who's st opped breathing. Respirat ors can take several different forms. Scuba-diving equipmentalways includes a respirat or, though it doesn'tact ually do the breathing for  the  diver. Medical respirat ors, which are used especially for babies and for emergency care and act ually take over the job of get t ing oxygen  int o  the  lungs, are  t oday  usually  called  vent ilat ors, so  as to dist inguish them from simple oxygen syst ems (which merely provide a st eady flow of oxygen int o the nostrils) and face masks.
 
==========transpire                        (1) To happen. (2) To become known.


?
 We kept up our quest ioning, and it soon transpired that the boys had known about the murder all along .


Since the prefix trans- means "through" (see TRANS) , transpire's most lit eral  meaning  is something like "breathe through." Thus, the original meaning of the English word-st ill used t oday-is to give off a wat ery vapor through a surface such as a leaf. From there, it came to mean also the gradual appearance of previously secret informat ion, as if leaking out  of the pores of a leaf (as in "It transpired that she was not only his employee butalso his girlfriend"). And soon it was being used to mean simply "happen" (as in "I wondered whathad transpired in the cafet eria at luncht ime").
 
==========VER comes from the Latin word for "truth." A verdict in a trial is "the truth spoken" (see DICT). Buta just verdict may depend on the veracity, or "truthfulness," of the wit nesses.
 
==========verify                      (1) To prove to be true or correct . (2) To check or t est the accuracy of.


?
 It is the bank t eller's job to verify the signat ure on a check.


During talks bet ween the Unit ed Stat es and the former Soviet Union on nuclear weapons reduct ion, one big problem was how to verify that weapons had been eliminat ed. Since neither side want ed the other to know it s secret s, verification of the fact s became a difficult issue. Because of the distrust on both sides, many doubt ed that the real numbers would ever be verifiable.
 
==========aver                 To stat e posit ively as true; declare.


?
 The defendantaverred that she was nowhere near the scene of the crime on the night in quest ion.


Since aver contains the "truth" root , it basically  means  "confirm  as  true."  You  may  aver anything that you're sure of. In legal sit uat ions, aver means to stat e posit ively as a fact ; thus, Perry Mason's client s aver that they are innocent , while the district  at t orney  avers  the opposit e. If you make such a stat ement while under oath, and it t urns out that you lied, you may have commit t ed the crime of perjury.
 
==========verisimilit ude
        (1) The appearance of being true or probable. (2) The depict ion of realism in art or lit erat ure.


?
 By the beginning of the 20th cent ury, the leading European paint ers were losing int erest in verisimilit ude and beginning to experiment with abstract ion.


From it s root s, verisimilitude means basically "similarit y to the truth." Most fict ion writ ers and filmmakers aim at some kind of verisimilit ude to give their st ories an air of realit y. They need not show something act ually true, or even very common, but simply something believable. A mass of good details in a play, novel, paint ing, or film may add verisimilit ude. A spy novel without some verisimilit ude won't int erest many readers, buta fantast ical novel may not even at t empt to seem true to life.
 
==========veracit y

==========TURB comes from the Latin verb turbare, "t o throw int o confusion or upset ," and the noun turba, "crowd" or "confusion." So a disturbance, for example, confuses and upset s normal order or rout ine.
 
==========t urbid        (1)  Thick  or  murky, especially  with  churned-up  sediment . (2)  Unclear, confused, muddled.


?
 The mood of the crowd was rest less and t urbid, and any spark could have t urned them int o a mob.


The Colorado River in spring, swollen by melt ing snow from the high mountains, races through the Grand Canyon, t urbid and churning. A chemical solut ion may be described as t urbid rather than clear. And your emot ions may be t urbid as well, especially where love is involved: What did he mean by that glance?
 Why did she say it like that ?

 
==========pert urb                       To upset , confuse, or disarrange.


?
 News of  the new peace accord was enough to pert urb some radical opponent s of  any set t lement s.


With it s per- prefix, perturb meant originally "thoroughly upset ," though t oday the word has lost most of it s int ense edge. Perturb and perturbation are oft en used by scient ist s, usually when speaking of a change in their data indicat ing that something has affect ed some normal process. When someone is referred to as imperturbable, it means he or she manages to remain calm through the most trying experiences.
 
==========t urbine             A rotary engine with blades made to t urn and generat e power by a current of wat er, st eam, or air under pressure.


?
 The power plant used huge t urbines powered by wat er going over the dam to generat e electricit y.


The oldestand simplest form of t urbine is the wat erwheel, which is made to rotat e by wat er falling across it s blades and int o bucket s suspended from them. Hero of Alexandria invent ed the  first  st eam-driven  t urbine  in  the  1st  cent ury A.D., but  a  commercially pract ical st eam t urbine wasn't developed unt il 1884; st eam t urbines are now the main element s of electric power stat ions. Jet engines are gas t urbines. A turbojet engine uses a t urbine to compress the incoming air that feeds the engine before being eject ed to push the plane forward; a turboprop engine uses it s exhaust to drive a t urbine that spins a propeller. A wind t urbine generat es electricit y by being t urned by the wind; the largest now have vanes with a t urning diamet er of over 400 feet .
 
==========t urbulent
  (1)  St irred  up,  agitat ed.  (2)  St irring  up  unrest ,  violence,  or dist urbance.


?
 The huge ocean liner Queen Elizabeth II was never much troubled by t urbulent seas that mighthave sunk smaller boat s.


Some people lead t urbulent lives, and some are constant ly in the grip of t urbulent emot ions. The lat e 1960s are remembered as t urbulent years of social revolut ion in America and Europe. Oft en the captain of an airplane will warn passengers to fast en their seat belt s because of upper-air turbulence, which can make for a bumpy ride. El Ni?

==========VOLU/VOLV comes from the Latin verb volvere, meaning "t o roll, wind, t urn around, or t wistaround." Thus, revolve simply means "t urn in circles." And a volume was originally a scroll or roll of papyrus.
 
==========voluble                           Speaking readily and rapidly; talkat ive.


?
 He proved to be a voluble informer who would t ell st ories of bookies, smugglers, and hit men to the det ect ives for hours.


A voluble person has words "rolling" off his or her t ongue. In O. Henry's famous st ory "The Ransom of Red Chief," the kidnappers nab a boy who t urns out to be so unbearably voluble that they can hardly wait to t urn him loose again.
 
==========devolve                ((1) To pass (responsibilit y, power, et c.) from one person or group to another person or group ata lower level of authorit y. (2) To gradually go from an advanced stat e to a less advanced stat e.


?
 Since 1998, considerable power has been devolving from the Brit ish government in London to the new Scot t ish Parliament in Edinburgh.


With it s de- prefix (see DE) , devolution implies moving backward. Once powers have been centralized in a unified government , giving any powers back-that is, devolving the power-t o a smaller governmental unit can seem to be reversing a nat ural development . In a somewhat similar way, a job that your boss doesn't want to do may devolve upon you. But devolve and devolution are also treat ed nowadays as the opposit es of evolve and evolution. So we may also speak of moral devolut ion, such as occurred in Germany in the 1930s, when a country with an extraordinary cult ure became a brutal dictat orship. And parent s may wat ch their slacker t eenager and wonder if devolut ion is occurring right in front of their eyes.
 
==========evolut ion
   A process of change from a lower, simpler, or worse stat e to one that is higher, more complex, or bet t er.


?
 Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers believed that polit ical evolut ion reached it s highest form in democracy.


Part of the humor of the old Flintstones cart oon show is that it contradict s what is known about biological evolut ion, since humans act ually evolved long aft er dinosaurs were ext inct . Evolution can also be used more broadly to refer to t echnology, societ y, and other human creat ions. For example, an idea may evolve, even in your own mind, as the months or years pass. And though many people don't believe thathuman beings truly become bet t er with the passing cent uries, many will argue that our societ ies t end to evolve, producing more goods and providing more prot ect ion for more people.
 
==========convolut ed
  (1)  Having  a  pat t ern  of  curved  windings.  (2)  Involved, intricat e.


?
 Aft er 10 minut es, Mr. Collins's strange st ory had become so convolut ed that none of us could follow it .


Convolution originally meanta complex winding pat t ern such as those visible on the surface of the brain. So a convolut ed argument or a convolut ed explanat ion is one that winds this way and that . An official document may have to wind it s way through a convolut ed process and be stamped by eight people before being approved. Convolut ed language makes many people suspicious; as a great philosopher once said, "Anything that can be said can be said clearly."

==========FAC comes from the Latin verb facere, meaning "t o make or do." Thus, a fact was originally simply "something done." A benefactor is someone who does good. And to manufacture is to make, usually in a factory.
 
==========fact or                    Something that contribut es to producing a result : ingredient .


?
 The most important fact or in the success of the treaty talks was the physical presence of the two president s.


In Latin factor means simply "doer." So in English a fact or is an "act or" or element or ingredient in some  sit uat ion  or quant it y. Charm can be a fact or in someone's success, and lack of exercise can be a fact or in producing a poor physique. In math we use factor to mean a number that can be mult iplied or divided to produce a given number (for example, 5 and 8 are fact ors of 40). And in biology a gene may be called a fact or, since genes are ingredient s in the t otal organism.
 
==========fact ot um
A person whose job involves doing many different kinds of work.


?
 Over the years she had become the office fact ot um, who might be doing legal research one day and organizing the company picnic the next .


This odd word doesn't come from ancient Latin, but it was coined to look as if it did. The t erm Johannes factotum, meaning "Jack-of-all-trades," first shows up in writ ing in 1592 to describe none other than Shakespeare himself. The word gofer is similar to factotum buta bit less dignified. In other words, a fact ot um is an assistant , but one who may have taken over some fairly important funct ions.
 
==========facile                  (1) Easily accomplished. (2) Shallow, superficial.


?
 The principal made a facile argument for the school's policy, but no one was convinced.


A facile suggest ion doesn't deal with the issue in any depth, and a facile solut ion may be only t emporarily effect ive. A facile writ er is one who seems to writ e t oo quickly and easily, and a careful reader may discover that the writ er hasn'treally said very much.
 
==========facilitat e To  make  (something)  easier; to make  (something)  run  more smoothly.


?
 Her uncle hadn't exact ly got t en her the job, buthe had certainly facilitat ed the process.


Facilitat ing is about get t ing things done. Clever employees are quiet ly facilitat ing all kinds of useful act ivit y  within  their organizat ions  all the  t ime. People  who  lead  therapy  groups  or workshops are oft en called facilitators, since their job isn't to t each or to order butrather to make  the  meet ings  as  product ive  as  possible. Even  businesses  now  use  facilitat ors  in meet ings where they don't  want  any person's part icular desires to out weigh anyone else's. Th e facilitation  of  a  rewarding  discussion  should  be  a  facilitat or's  only  goal.  Today,  in recognit ion of the many different  sit uat ions that  may call for a facilitat or, there is even an Int ernat ional Associat ion of Facilitat ors.
 
==========LUM comes from the Latin noun lumen, meaning "light ." Thus, our word illuminate means "t o supply with light " or "make clear," and illumination is light that shines on something.
 
==========lumen                     In physics, the standard unit for measuring the rat e of the flow of light .


?
 The lumen is a measure of the perceived power of light .


There are two common unit s for measuring light , the candela and the lumen. Both are recognized as standard int ernat ional unit s, which also include the second (for t ime), the kilogram (for weight ), and the met er (for length). The candela is a measure of int ensit y; an ordinary candle gives off light with the int ensit y of about one candela. The lumen is a measure of "luminous flux"; a standard 100-wat t light bulb gives off 1500-1700 lumens. Luminous flux indicat es how much light is act ually perceived by the human eye. Technologies vary in how efficient ly they t urn electricit y int o light ; halogen light s produce about 12 lumens per wat t , ordinary incandescent light bulbs produce about 15 lumens per wat t , and compact fluorescent bulbs produce about 50 lumens per wat t .
 
==========luminous
(1) Producing or seeming to produce light . (2) Filled with light .


?
 She ended her recital with a luminous performance of Ravel's song cycle, and the crowd called her back for repeat ed encores.


Luminous, like it s synonyms radiant, shining, glowing, and lustrous, is generally a posit ive adject ive, especially when it describes something that doesn't lit erally glow, such as a face, a performance, or a poem. Luminous signs depend on a gas such as neon, krypt on, argon, xenon, or radon-and you can use luminous (DayGlo) paint to make your own signs. New t echnologies have now given us luminous fabrics, which are being used to produce striking or creepy effect s in clothing, upholst ery, and int erior surfaces.
 
==========bioluminescent
             Relat ing to light given off by living organisms.


?
 Most of the light emit t ed by bioluminescent marine organisms is blue or blue-green.


Bio- comes from the Greek word for "life" (see BIO). On land, fireflies, glowworms, and the fox- fire fungus are all known for their bioluminescence. In the sea, bioluminescent life-forms include plankt on, squid, and comb jellies, as well as some unusual fish. Most deep-sea animals are bioluminescent , but single-celled algae living at or near the surface can also creat e a remarkable show, as they oft en do in Bioluminescent Bay on the Puert o Rican island  of Vieques. But bioluminescence is unknown in true plant s, and mammals, birds, rept iles, and amphibians never got the knack of it either.
 
==========luminary A very famous or dist inguished person.


?
 Ent ering the glit t ering recept ion room, she immediat ely spot t ed several luminaries of the art world.


The  Latin  word luminaria  could  mean  either  "lamps"  or  "heavenly  bodies."  For  medieval astrologers, the luminaries were the sun and the moon, the bright est object s in the heavens. Today a luminary is usually a person of "brilliant " achievement : a celebrit y, a "leading light ," or a "star."

==========Words from Mythology and History

muse                  A source of inspirat ion; a guiding spirit .


?
 At 8:00 each morning he sat down athis desk and summoned his muse, and she almostalways responded.


The Muses were the nine Greek goddesses who presided over the art s (including music) and lit erat ure. A shrine to the Muses was called in Latin a museum. An art ist or poetabout to begin work would call on his part icular Muse to inspire him, and a poem it self might begin with such a call; thus, Homer's Odyssey begins, "Sing to me of the man, Muse" (that is, of Odysseus). Today a muse may be one's special creat ive spirit , but some art ist s and writ ers have also chosen living human beings to serve as their muses.
 
==========iridescent
   Having a glowing, rainbowlike play of color that seems to change as the light shift s.


?
 The children shrieked with glee as the iridescent soap bubbles float ed away in the gent le breeze.


Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow, t ook messages from Mount Olympus to earth, and from gods to mortals or other gods, using the rainbow as her stairway. Iridescence is thus the glowing, shift ing, colorful qualit y of a rainbow, also seen in an opal, a light oil slick, a but t erfly wing, or the mother-of-pearl that lines an oyst er shell.
 
==========mausoleum                          (1) A large  t omb, especially  one  built  aboveground  with shelves for the dead. (2) A large, gloomy building or room.


?
 The family's grand mausoleum occupied a prominent spot in the cemet ery, for all the good it did the silent dead within.


Mausolus was ruler of a kingdom in Asia Minor in the 4th cent ury B.C. He beaut ified the capital, Halicarnassus, with all sort s of fine public buildings, buthe is best known for the magnificent monument , the Mausoleum, that was built by his wife Art emisia aft er his death. With it s greatheight (perhaps 140 feet ) and many beaut iful sculpt ures, the Mausoleum was declared one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Though Halicarnassus was repeat edly at tacked, the Mausoleum would survive for well over 1,000 years.
 
==========ment or                        A trust ed counselor, guide, t ut or, or coach.


?
 This pleasant old gent leman had served as friend and ment or to a series of young lawyers in the firm.


Odysseus was away from home fight ing and journeying for 20 years, according to Homer. During that t ime, the son he leftas a babe in arms grew up under the supervision of Ment or, an old and trust ed friend. When the goddess Athena decided it was t ime to complet e young Telemachus's educat ion by sending him off to learn abouthis father, she visit ed him disguised as Ment or and they set out t ogether. Today, anyone such as a coach or t ut or who gives another (usually younger) person help and advice on how to achieve success in the larger world is called a ment or. And in recent years we've even been using the word as a verb, and now in business we oft en speak of an experienced employee mentoring someone who has justarrived.
 
==========narcissism
  (1) Extreme self-cent eredness or fascinat ion with oneself. (2) Love or desire for one's own body.


?
 His girlfriend would complain abouthis narcissism, saying he spent more t ime looking athimself in the mirror than ather.


Narcissus was a handsome youth in Greek mythology who inspired love in many who saw him. One was the nymph Echo, who could only repeat the last thing thatanyone said. When Narcissus cruelly reject ed her, she wast ed away to nothing buther voice. Though he played with the affect ions of others, Narcissus became a vict im of his own at tract iveness. When he caught sight of his own reflect ion in a pool, he sat gazing at it in fascinat ion, wast ing away without food or drink, unable to t ouch or kiss the image he saw. When he finally died, the gods t urned him int o the flower we call the narcissus, which stands with it s head bentas though gazing at it s reflect ion. People with "narcissistic personalit y disorder" have a somewhat serious mental condit ion, according to psychologist s, but the rest of us are free to call anyone who seems vain and self-cent ered a narcissist.
 
==========tantalize                       To t ease or t orment by offering something desirable but keeping it out of reach.


?
 The sight of a warm fire through the window tantalized the lit t le mat ch girl almost unbearably.


King Tantalus, according to Greek mythology, killed his son Pelops and served him to the gods in a st ew for dinner. Almostall the gods realized what was happening and refused the meal, though only aft er Demet er had taken a nibble out of  Pelops's  shoulder. Aft er  they  had reconstruct ed him, replacing the missing shoulder with a piece of ivory, they t urned to punishing Tantalus. In Hades he stands in wat er up to his neck under a tree laden with fruit . Each t ime he st oops to drink, the wat er moves out of reach; each t ime he reaches up to pick something, the branches move beyond his grasp. He is thus et ernally tantalized by the wat er and fruit . Today anything or anyone that t empt s but is unobtainable is tantalizing.
 
==========thespian
 An act or.


?
 In summer the t owns of New England welcome troupes of thespians dedicat ed to present ing plays of all kinds.


Greek drama was originally ent irely performed by choruses. According to tradit ion, the Greek dramat ist Thespis, of the 6th cent ury B.C., was the invent or of tragedy and the first to writ e roles for the individual act or as dist inct from the chorus, and the act or's exchanges with the chorus were the first dramat ic dialogue. Since Thespis himself performed the individual part s in his own plays, he was also the first true act or. Ever since choruses disappeared from drama, thespians have filled all the roles in plays. Thespian is also an adject ive; thus, we can speak of "thespian ambit ions" and "thespian tradit ions," for example.

The ancient Greeks called the west wind Zephyrus and regarded him and his fellows-Boreas (god of the north wind), Eurus (god of the east wind), and Not us (god of the south wind)-as gods. A zephyr is a kind wind, bringer of clear skies and beaut iful weather.

==========umber                    (1) A darkish brown mineral containing manganese and iron oxides used for coloring paint . (2) A color that is greenish brown to dark reddish brown.


?
 Van Dyke prized umber as a pigmentand used it constant ly in his oil paint ings.


The mineral deposit s of Italy provided sources of a number of nat ural pigment s, among them umber. Since the lat e Renaissance, umber has been in great demand as a coloring agent . When crushed and mixed with paint , it produces an olive color known as raw umber; when crushed and burnt , it produces a darker t one known as burnt umber.
 
==========adumbrat e                        (1) To give a sket chy out line or disclose in part . (2) To hintat or foret ell.


?
 The Secretary of Stat e would only adumbrat e his ideas for bringing peace to Bosnia.


A synonym for adumbrate is foreshadow, which means to presenta shadowy  version  of something before it becomes realit y or is provided in full. Tough quest ioning by a Supreme Court just ice may adumbrat e the way he or she is planning to rule on a case. A bad review by a crit ic may adumbrat e the failure of a new film. And rat s scurrying off a ship were believed to adumbrat e a coming disast er at sea.
 
==========penumbra                      (1) The part ial shadow surrounding a complet e shadow, as in an eclipse. (2) The fringe or surrounding area where something exist s less fully.


?
 This area of the invest igat ion was the penumbra where both the FBI and the CIA want ed to pursue their leads.


Every solar eclipse cast s an umbra, the darker central area in which almost no lightreaches the earth, and a penumbra, the area of part ial shadow where part of the sun is st ill visible. Penumbra can thus be used to describe any "gray area" where things aren'tall black and whit e. For example, the right to privacy falls under the penumbra of the U.S. Const it ut ion; though it isn't specifically guarant eed there, the Supreme Courthas held that it is implied, and thus that the government may not intrude int o certain areas of a cit izen's privat e life. Because it s exist ence is st ill shadowy, however, the Court is st ill det ermining how much of an individual's life is prot ect ed by the right to privacy.
 
==========umbrage         A feeling of  resent ment  at  some slight  or insult , oft en one that  is imagined rather than real.


?
 She oft en t ook umbrage athis treat ment of her, without being able to pinpoint what was offensive about it .


An umbrage was originally a shadow, and soon the word also began to mean "a shadowy suspicion." Then it came to mean "displeasure" as well-that is, a kind of shadow blocking the sunlight . Umbrage is now generally used in the phrase "take umbrage at ." An overly sensit ive person may take umbrage at something as small as having his or her name pronounced wrong.
 
==========VEST comes from the Latin verb vestire,  "t o  clothe"  or  "t o  dress,"  and  the  noun vestis, "clothing" or "garment ." Vest is the short est English word we have from this root , and is the name of a rather small piece of clothing.
 
==========divest (1) To getrid of or free oneself of propert y, authorit y, or t it le. (2) To strip of clothing, ornament s, or equipment .


?
 In prot estagainstapartheid, many universit ies in the 1980s divest ed themselves of all st ock in South African companies.


If you decide to ent er a monast ery, you may divest yourself of most of your possessions. When a church is officially abandoned, it 's usually divest ed of it s ornament s and furnishings. A company that 's going through hard t imes may divest it self of several st ores, and invest ors are constant ly divest ing themselves of st ocks that  aren't  performing well enough. And when it t urns out thatathlet es have been using st eroids, they're usually divest ed of any awards they may have won.
 
==========invest it ure
  The formal placing of someone in office.


?
 Atan English monarch's invest it ure, he or she is present ed with the crown, scept er, and sword, the symbols of power.


In it s original meaning, an investiture was the clothing of a new officeholder in garment s that symbolized power. The Middle Ages saw much debat e over the invest it ure of bishops by kings and emperors. These rulers felt thathigh religious offices were theirs to give as rewards for someone's loyal service or as bribes for someone's fut ure support ; the popes, on the other hand, regarded these invest it ures as the improper buying and selling of church offices. The invest it ure struggle caused t ension bet ween popes and monarchs and even led to wars.
 
==========transvest it e                           A person, especially a male, who wears the clothing and adopt s the mannerisms of the opposit e sex.


?
 In  Handel's  operas,  the  heroic  male  leading  roles  are  t oday  oft en  sung  by  female transvest it es, since he originally wrot e them for the soprano range.


Transvestite includes the prefix trans-, "across," and thus means lit erally "cross-dresser." In the theat er, from ancient Greece to Elizabethan England, transvestism was common because all part s-even Juliet -were played by men. Tradit ional Japanese Kabuki and Noh drama st ill employ transvest ism of this sort . In everyday life, it 's now so acceptable for women to wear men's clothing that the word transvestite is generally applied only to men. The much newer word transgender describes people who think of themselves as having changed sex, or who simply don't believe in the idea that they're either one sex or the other.
 
==========travest y                   (1) An inferior or dist ort ed imitat ion. (2) A broadly comic imitat ion in drama, lit erat ure, or art that is usually grot esque and ridiculous.


?
 The senat or was shout ing that the new tax bill represent ed a travest y of tax reform.


The word travesty comes from the same prefix and rootas transvestite. Since cross-dressing oft en isn't  very convincing, the word has usually referred to something absurd. So a verdict  thatangers people may be denounced as a "travest y of just ice." Saturday Night Live specializes in dramat ic travest ies mocking everything from polit ical figures and issues to popular cult ure-"disguised" versions int ended for ent ertainment . Travesty may also be a verb; thus, Mel Brooks has travest ied movie genres of all kinds-west erns, thrillers, and silent films, among others.

==========THE/THEO comes from the Greek word meaning "god." Theology, the st udy of religion, is pract iced by theologians. Monotheism is the worship of a single god; Christ ianit y, Islam, and Judaism are monotheistic religions, and all three worship the same god. Polytheistic religions such as those of ancient Greece and Rome, on the other hand, worship many gods.
 
==========apotheosis
     (1) Transformat ion int o a god. (2) The perfect example.


?
 Abraham Lincoln's apotheosis aft er his assassinat ion transformed the controversial polit ician int o the saint ly savior of his country.


In ancient Greece, hist orical figures were somet imes worshipped as gods. In Rome, apotheosis was rare unt il the emperor August us declared the dead Julius Caesar to be a god, and soon other dead emperors were being apotheosized as well. In older paint ings you may see a heroic figure-Napoleon, George Washingt on, or Shakespeare, for example-being raised int o the clouds, symbolizing his or her apotheosis. But t oday any great classic example of something can be called it s apotheosis. You mighthear it said, for example, that Baroque music reached it s apotheosis in the works of J. S. Bach, or that the Duesenberg Phaet on was the apotheosis of the t ouring car.
 
==========atheist ic
  Denying the exist ence of God or divine power.


?
 The atheist ic Madalyn Murray O'Hair successfully sought the removal of prayer from American public schools in the 1960s.


In the Roman Empire, early Christ ians were called atheist ic because they denied the exist ence of the Roman gods. And once the Christ ian church was firmly established, it condemned the Romans as atheists because they didn't believe in the Christ ian God. In lat er cent uries, English- speaking Christ ians would oft en use the words pagan and heathen to describe such non- Christ ians, while atheist would be reserved for those who act ually denied the exist ence of any god. Atheism is different from agnosticism, which claims that the exist ence of any higher power is  unknowable; and  lot s  of  people  who  simply  don't  think  much  about  religion  oft en  call themselves agnostics as well.
 
==========pantheon                  (1)  A  building  serving  as  the  burial  place  of  or  containing memorials to the famous dead of a nat ion. (2) A group of notable persons or things.


?
 A Hall of Fame serves as a kind of pantheon for it s field, and those admit t ed in the early years are oft en the great est of all.


Each of the importantroman gods and goddesses had many t emples erect ed in their name. But in 27 B.C. a t emple to all the gods t ogether was complet ed in Rome; t wice destroyed, it was ult imat ely replaced by a third t emple around A.D. 126. This extraordinary domed struct ure is st ill one of the important sight s of Rome, and the burial place for the paint ers Raphael and Carracci and two kings. In Paris, a great church  was  complet ed  in  1789-90; named  the Panthon, it was announced as the fut ure rest ing place of France's great figures, and the bodies of Vict or Hugo, Louis Past eur, Marie Curie, and many others now rest within it s walls.
 
==========theocracy                       (1)  Government  by  officials  who  are  regarded  as  divinely inspired. (2) A stat e governed by a theocracy.


?
 The ancientazt ecs lived in a theocracy in which guidance came direct ly from the gods through the priest s.


In the Middle Ages, the Muslim empires stret ching around much of the Medit erranean were theocracies, and the pope ruled most of modern-day Italy. But theocracies are rare t oday. Modern Iran and Saudi Arabia (and perhaps half a dozen others) are usually regarded as theocratic government s, since, even though Iran's president is elect ed by popular vot e and Saudi Arabia is ruled by a royal family, the countries' laws are religious laws. But when a government tries to follow all the t eachings of a single religion, things usually don't work out t erribly well, so U.S. Const it ut ion and Bill of Right s forbid using religion as the principal basis for democracy.
 
==========ICON comes from the Greek eikon, which led to the Latin icon, both meaning "image." Though the icon- roothasn't produced many English words, the words that is does appear in t end to be int erest ing.
 
==========icon        (1) A religious image usually paint ed on a small wooden panel: idol. (2) Emblem, symbol.


?
 Henry Ford's assembly line capt ured the imaginat ion of the world, and he and his company became icons of industrial capitalism.


In the East ern Orthodox church, much importance is given to icons, usually small portrait s on wood-somet imes with gold-leaf paint -of Jesus, Mary, or a saint , which hang in churches and in the houses of the faithful. The Orthodox church favors icons part ly because they communicat e direct ly and forcefully even to uneducat ed people. They are regarded as sacred; some believers act ually pray to them, and many believe that icons have carried out miracles. The common modern uses of icon grew out of this original sense. The fact that Orthodox icons have a symbolic role led to icon being used to mean simply "symbol." Because of the icon's sacredness, the t erm also came to mean "idol." And once we began to use idol to refer to pop-cult ure stars, it wasn't long before we began using icon the same way. But for the lit t le comput er-deskt op images that you click on, the older meaning of "symbol" is the one we're thinking of.
 
==========iconic                       (1) Symbolic. (2) Relat ing to a great ly admired and successful person or thing.


?
 The 1963 March on Washingt on was the iconic event in the hist ory of the civil-right s movement , now familiar to all American schoolchildren.


The original meaning of iconic was essent ially "resembling an icon," but t oday it more oft en seems to mean "so admired that it could be the subject of an icon." And with that meaning, iconic has become part of the language of advert ising and publicit y; t oday companies and magazines and TV host s are constant ly encouraging us to think of some consumer it em or pop star or show as first -rat e or immortal or flawless-absolut ely "iconic"-when he or she or it is act ually nothing of the kind.
 
==========iconoclast
  (1) A person who destroys religious images or opposes their use. (2) A person who at tacks set t led beliefs or inst it ut ions.


?
 She's always rat t ling her friends by saying outrageous things, and she enjoys her reputat ion as an iconoclast .


When the early books of the Bible were being writ t en, most of the other Middle East ern religions had more than one god; these religions generally encouraged the worship of idols of the various gods, which were oft en regarded as magical object s. But in the  Ten Commandment s given to Moses in the Old Testament , God prohibit s the making of "graven images" or "idols" for worship, proclaiming that the Jews are to worship only one God, who is t oo great to be represent ed in an idol. However, by the 6th cent ury A.D., Christ ians had begun to creat e religious images in order to focus the prayers of the faithful. Opposit ion to icons led to the Iconoclastic Controversy in A.D. 726, when, support ed by the pope, iconoclast s began smashing and burning the images in churches and monast eries (clast- comes from the Greek word meaning "t o break"). In t ime, peace was rest ored, and almostall Christ ians have since accept ed depict ions of Jesus, Mary, and the saint s. Today an iconoclast is someone who constant ly argues with convent ional thinking, refusing to "worship" the object s of everyone else's "faith."
 
==========iconography
  (1) The imagery and symbolism of a work of art or an art ist .
(2) The st udy of art ist ic symbolism.


?
 Today scholars pore over the advert isement s in glossy magazines, st udying the iconography for clues to the ads' hidden meanings.


If you saw a 17th-cent ury paint ing of a man writ ing ata desk with a lion athis feet , would you know you were looking at St . Jerome, translat or of the Bible, who, according to legend, once pulled a thorn from the paw of a lion, which thereaft er became his devot ed friend?
 And if a paint ing showed a young woman reclining on a bed with a shower of gold descending on her, would you recognize her as Dana?
, locked up in a t ower to keep her away from the lust ful Zeus, who then managed to gain access to her by transforming himself int o golden light (or golden coins)?
 An iconographic approach to art can make museum-going a lot of fun-and amat eur iconographers know there are also plent y of symbols lurking in the images thatadvert isers bombard us with daily.

==========URB comes from the Latin noun for "cit y." Our word urban describes cit ies and the people who live in them. With it s sub- prefix (see SUB), a suburb is a t own "near" or "under" a larger cit y, and suburban houses are home to suburbanites.
 
==========urbane                     Sophist icat ed and with polished manners.


?
 He was remembered as a gent lemanly and urbane host of elegant dinner part ies.


Urbane's synonyms include suave, debonair, and especially cosmopolitan. Urbanity was a trait of such classic movie stars as Fred Astaire, Cary Grant , William Powell, Leslie Howard, Charles Boyer, and George Sanders. (Not ice that , for some reason, urbane is almostalways used to describe men rather than women.) Teenagers in the 1960s read James Bond novels and wat ched his charact er onscreen to get t ips aboutacquiring an urbane ident it y. But it 's hard to acquire urbanit y withoutact ually having had wide social experience in sophist icat ed cit ies.

==========exurban                      Relat ing to a region or set t lement  that  lies out side a cit y and usually beyond it s suburbs and oft en is inhabit ed chiefly by well-t o-do families.


?
 Exurban areas t ypically show much higher educat ion and income levels than closer-in suburbs or nearby rural count ies.


With it s prefix ex-, ("out side of," the noun exurb was coined around 1955 to describe the ring of well-off communit ies beyond the suburbs that were becoming commut er t owns for an urban area. Most exurbs were probably quiet lit t le t owns before being discovered by young cit y dwellers with good incomes looking for a pleasant place to raise  their children. Planners, advert isers, and polit ical strat egist s t oday oft en talk about such t opics as exurban development , exurban trends, exurban migrat ion, and exurban vot ers.
 
==========int erurban
      Going bet ween or connect ing cit ies or t owns.


?
 Businesspeople in the  two cit ies  have  been  wait ing  for decades  for a  true  high-speed int erurban railway on the Japanese model.


Interurban is generally used to describe transportat ion. As a noun (as in "In those days you could take the int erurban from Seat t le to Tacoma"), interurban has meanta fairly heavy but fast electric train, something bet ween an urban trolley and a full-fledged long-distance train, that offers more frequent service than an ordinary railway. Int erurban transit t oday may include bus, ferry, and limousine-and, in a few lucky areas, a regional railway. With oil supplies dwindling, there's hope that int erurban railways will be coming back int o wider use.
 
==========urbanizat ion
      The process by which t owns and cit ies are formed and become larger as more and more people begin living and working in central areas.


?
 The area has been undergoing rapid urbanizat ion, and six or seven of the old small t owns are now genuine suburbs.


The word urbanization start ed appearing in print way back in the 1880s, which says something about the growth of American cit ies. The expansion of Los Angeles was an early example of uncontrolled urbanizat ion. Urbanizat ion is oft en seen as a negat ive trend, with bad effect s on qualit y of life and the environment . Butapart ment s require much less heat than houses, and commut ing by mass transitrather than cars can reduce pollut ion and energy use, and cit ies offer improved opport unit ies for jobs (and oft en for educat ion and housing as well), so cit y growth doesn't make everyone unhappy.
 
==========CULT comes from the Latin cultus, meaning "care." So cultivation is care of something, such as a garden, in a way that encourages it s growth. And culture is what is produced by cult ivat ing human knowledge, skills, beliefs, manners, science, and art over many years.
 
==========accult urat ion
         (1) Modificat ion of the cult ure of an individual, group, or people by adapt ing to or borrowing trait s from another cult ure. (2) The process by which a human being acquires the cult ure of a part icular societ y from infancy.


?
 The old East ern European bagel has gone through an accult urat ion in America, where ithas acquired a soft t ext ure, a whit e int erior, and fillers like eggs and peanut but t er.


Whenever people come in close contact with a populat ion that 's more powerful, they're generally forced to acculturate in order to survive. Learning a new language is usually part of the accult urat ion process, which may also include adopt ing new clothing, a new diet , new occupat ions, and even a new religion. An older generat ion oft en fails to accult urat e thoroughly, but their children oft en pick up the new ways quickly.
 
==========cross-cult ural                          Dealing with or offering comparison bet ween two or more different cult ures or cult ural areas.


?
 A cross-cult ural st udy of 49 tribes revealed a t ightrelat ionship bet ween the closeness of mother-infant bonding in a given tribe and that tribe's peacefulness t oward it s neighbors.


If you've ever traveled in a foreign country, you've found yourself making some cross-cult ural comparisons: Why are huge family dinners so much more common in Italy than back home?
 Why  do  Mexican  t eenagers  seem to play  with  their  lit t le  relat ives  so  much  more than t eenagers in the U.S.?
 Cross-cult ural analysis has produced extremely int erest ing data about such things as the effect s of various nat ions' diet s on their populat ions' health. Though cross- cultural was originally  used by anthropologist s to refer to research comparing aspect s  of different cult ures, it 's also oft en used to describe the realit y that lot s of us face daily while simply walking the street s of a big American cit y.
 
==========hort icult ure
  The science and art of growing fruit s, vegetables, flowers, or ornamental plant s.


?
 He considered majoring in botany, buthas decided inst ead on hort icult ure, hoping he can spend more t ime in a greenhouse than in the library or the lab.


Hortus is Latin for "garden," and the first gardens were plant ed about 10,000 years ago in what is oft en called the Fert ile Crescent -the crescent -shaped area stret ching from Israel north through Syria and down Iraq's two greatrivers to the Persian Gulf. Probably more fert ile in previous cent uries than it is t oday, it was the original home of such food plant s as wheat , barley, peas, and lent ils or their ancientancest ors (not to ment ion the ancest ors of cows, pigs, sheep, and goat s as well). Many horticulturists t oday work as researchers or plant breeders or t end orchards and greenhouses-but mostamerican households  contain  at  least  one amat eur hort icult urist .
 
==========subcult ure
 A group whose beliefs and behaviors are different from the main groups within a cult ure or societ y.


?
 Members of the emo subcult ure ather high school recognized each other by their skinny jeans, dyed hair, and canvas sneakers.


This common meaning of subculture (ithas an older biological meaning) only appeared in the 1930s, and for about  20  years  it  was  used  most ly  by  sociologist s,  psychologist s,  and anthropologist s. But in the 1950s, as America's wealth led to more and more t eenagers get t ing their own cars and thus their independence, not to ment ion the arrival of rock 'n' roll, people not iced something unusual happening among young people, and began to speak of the "youth subcult ure." As the country's wealth and freedom of movement cont inued to increase, we realized that the U.S. had become home to a large number of subcult ures. Today the Web makes possible more than anyone could have dreamed of back in the 1950s. When we happen to st umble on a subcult ure-bodybuilders, Trekkies, hackers, Airstreamers, anime  lovers, mot ocross enthusiast s-we may realize with ast onishment that we had never even imagined that it might exist .

Demographic analysis, the stat ist ical descript ion of human populat ions, is a t ool used by governmentagencies, polit ical part ies, and manufact urers of consumer goods. Polls conduct ed on every t opic imaginable, from age to t oothpast e preference, give the governmentand corporat ions an idea of who the public is and what it needs and want s. The government 's census, which is conduct ed every t en years, is the largest demographic survey of all.

Since the panda is found in the wild exclusively in central China and east ern Tibet , scient ist s say it 's "endemic t o" those areas. But the word can also mean simply "common" or "t ypical"; so we can say that corrupt ion is endemic in the government of a country, that colds are "endemic in" nursery school, or that love of Barbie dolls is "endemic among" young American girls. Don't confuse endemic with epidemic; something can be endemic in a region for cent uries without ever "exploding."
 
==========demagogue
   A polit ical leader who appeals to the emot ions and prejudices of people in order to arouse discont entand to advance his or her own polit ical purposes.


?
 His support ers called him a "man of the people"; his enemies called him a lying demagogue.


Demagogue was once defined by the writ er H. L. Mencken as "one who will preach doctrines he knows to be untrue to men he knows to be idiot s," and Mencken's definit ion st ill works quit e well. The "doctrines" (ideas) preached by demagogues will nat urally always be the kind thatappeal direct ly to the ordinary vot er, the "common man" or "lit t le guy." Appealing to the common people is not it self a bad thing, but ithas oft en been used by those who calculat e that demagoguery (or demagogy) is the easiest way to power. In most countries, fear of demagogic leaders is so strong that vot ers aren't even permit t ed to vot e direct ly for the nat ion's leader, but inst ead vot e only for a local representat ive.
 
==========demot ic                        Popular or common.


?
 Part ly because of t elevision, the demot ic language and accent s of America's various regions have become more and more similar.


For many years demotic was used only to describe the writ ing of ancient Egypt , as the name of the script used by ordinary Egypt ians rather than by their priest s. Demotic is st ill an int ellect ual word, but it can now be used to describe any popular st yle in contrast to a st yle associat ed with a higher class, especially a st yle of speech or writ ing. So, for example, demot ic Californian is different from demot ic Texan. The most demot ic dress t oday is probably blue jeans and sneakers, and those who wear them have demot ic tast e in fashion. The problem is, in American societ y it can somet imes be hard to find a st yle that can't be described as demot ic.
 
==========POPUL comes from the Latin word meaning "people," and in fact forms the basis of the word people it self. So the population is the people of an area, and popular means not only "liked by many people" butalso (as in popular culture) "relat ing to the general public."
 
==========populist
 A believer in the right s, wisdom, or virt ues of the common people.


?
 He knew he would have to campaign as a populist in order to appeal to the working-class vot ers.


The word populist firstappeared in the 1890s with the founding of the Populist Part y, which st ood for the int erest s of the farmers against the big-money int erest s. In lat er years populism came to be associat ed with the blue-collar class in the cit ies as well. Populism can be hard to predict . It somet imes has a religious t endency; it usually isn't very int erest ed in int ernat ional affairs; ithas somet imes  been  unfriendly to immigrant s  and  blacks; and  it 's  oft en  ant i- int ellect ual. So populism oft en swit ches bet ween liberal and conservat ive. But the populist st yle always shows it s concern with Americans with average incomes as opposed to the rich and powerful.
 
==========populace
 (1) The common people or masses. (2) Populat ion.


?
 Perhaps Henry Ford's major achievement was to manufact ure a car that pract ically the ent ire populace could afford-the Model T.


Populace is usually used to refer to all the people of a country. Thus, we're oft en t old thatan educat ed and informed populace is essent ial for a healthy American democracy. Franklin D. Roosevelt 's famous radio "Fireside Chat s" informed and reassured the American populace in the 1930s as we struggled through the Great Depression. We oft en hear about what "the general populace" is thinking or doing, but generalizing about something so huge can be tricky.
 
==========populous Numerous, densely set t led, or having a large populat ion.


?
 Mostamericans can't locat e Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world, on a map.


With a metropolitan area of more than 20 million people, Mexico Cit y could be called the world's second or third most populous cit y. And the nearby Azt ec cit y of Tenocht it ln was one of the largest cit ies in the world even when Hernn Cort s arrived there in 1519. But by the t ime Cort s conquered the cit y in 1521 it wasn't nearly so populous, since European diseases had great ly reduced the populat ion.  Avoid confusing populous and populace,   which are pronounced exact ly the same.
 
==========vox populi
   Popular sent iment or opinion.


?
 Successful polit icians are always list ening to the vox populi and adjust ing their opinions or language accordingly.


Dat ing from at least the t ime of Charlemagne, the Latin saying "Vox populi, vox Dei" means lit erally "The voice of the people is the voice of God"-in other words, the people's voice is sacred, or the people are always right . Today, by means of modern opinion polls, we seem to hear the vox populi (or vox pop for short ) year-round on every possible issue. But maybe we should occasionally keep in mind that full Charlemagne-era quotat ion: "Those people should not be list ened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of God, since the riot ousness of the crowd is always very close to madness."

==========Animal Words

aquiline                          (1) Relat ing to eagles. (2) Curving like an eagle's beak.


?
 The surviving bust s of noble Romans show that many of the men had strong aquiline noses.


Aquiline, from the Latin word meaning "eagle," is most oft en used to describe a nose thathas a broad curve and is slight ly hooked, like a beak. The aquiline figure on the U.S. seal brandishes the arrows of war and the olive branch of peace. The word for eagle it self, Aquila, has been given to a const ellat ion in the northern hemisphere.
 
==========asinine                        Foolish, brainless.


?
 He's not so great when he's sober, but when he's drunk he get s truly asinine.


The donkey, or ass, has oft en been accused of st ubborn, willful, and st upid behavior lacking in logic and common sense. Asinine behavior exhibit s similar qualit ies. Idiot ic or rude remarks, aggressive st upidit y, and general immat urit y can all earn someone (usually a man)  this descript ion. If you call him this to his face, however, he might behave even worse.
 
==========bovine                     (1) Relat ing to cows and oxen. (2) Placid, dull, unemot ional.


?
 In that part of Texas, many of the vet erinarians specialize in bovine condit ions and won't even deal with dogs or cat s.


Bovine comes from the Latin word for "cow," though the biological family called the Bovidae act ually includes not only cows and oxen butalso goat s, sheep, bison, and buffalo. So bovine is oft en used t echnically, when discussing "bovine diseases," "bovine anat omy," and so on. It can also describe a human personalit y, though it can be a rather unkind way to describe someone. When Hera, the wife of Zeus, is called "cow-eyed," though, it 's definit ely a compliment , and Zeus fairly melt s when she t urns those big bovine eyes on him.
 
==========canine                    Relat ing to dogs or the dog family; doglike.


?
 Pleasure in get t ing their t ummies rubbed must be a basic canine trait , since all our dogs have loved it .


Dogs are prized for their talent s and int elligence butaren'talways given credit for their independence. Inst ead, tales of canine devot ion and at tachmentare legendary; the old Lassie and Rin-Tin-Tin t elevision series feat ured at least one heroic act of devot ion per show. So we oft en hear people described as having "doglike devot ion" or "doglike loyalt y." But canine it self, unlike doglike, usually refers to four-legged creat ures. Canine is not only an adject ive butalso a noun. Dogs and their relat ives in the Canidae family-the wolves, jackals, foxes, and coyot es
-are oft en called canines. And so are those two slight ly point ed t eeth a bit to the rightand left of your front t eeth.
 
==========feline                 (1) Relat ing to cat s or the cat family. (2) Like a cat in being sleek, graceful, sly, treacherous, or st ealthy.


?
 The performers moved across the high wire with feline grace and agilit y.


Cat s have always provoked a strong react ion from humans. The Egypt ians worshipped them, leaving thousands of feline mummies and idols as evidence. In the Middle Ages, felines were feared as agent s of the devil, and were thought to creep around silent ly at night doing evil. (Not ice that feline is also a noun.) The fascinat ing family called the Felidae includes about 40 species of superb hunt ers, including the lions, t igers, jaguars, cheetahs, cougars, bobcat s, and lynxes, and almostall of them are smooth, silent , and independent .
 
==========leonine                       Relat ing to lions; lionlike.


?
 As he conduct ed, Leonard Bernst ein would fling his leonine mane wildly about .


The Latin word for "lion" is leon, so the names Leon, Leo, and Leona all mean "lion" as well. A leonine head usually has magnificenthair, like a male lion's mane. The leonine strength of Heracles (Hercules) is symbolized by the lion's pelt thathe wears, the pelt of the fabled Nemean Lion which he had slain as one of his Twelve Labors. But leonine courage is what is so notably lacking in The Wizard of Oz's Cowardly Lion.
 
==========porcine                      Relat ing to pigs or swine; piglike.


?
 She describes her landlord's shape as porcine, and claims he has manners to mat ch.


Pigs are rarely given credit for their high int elligence or their friendliness as pet s, but inst ead are mocked for their habit of cooling themselves in mud puddles and the aggressive way they oft en go aft er food. While porcine isn'tas negat ive a t erm as swinish, it may describe things thatare fat , greedy, pushy, or generally piggish-but primarily fat . Porky Pig and Miss Piggy aren't part icularly porcine in their behavior, only in their appearance-that is, pink and pudgy.
 
==========vulpine                     (1) Relat ing to foxes; foxlike. (2) Sneaky, clever, or craft y; foxy.


?
 She'd already decided she didn't like anything abouthim, especially the t wit chiness, that vulpine face, and those dart ing eyes.


Foxes may be sleek and graceful runners with beaut iful coat s and tails, but they're almost impossible to keep out of the henhouse. Over the cent uries they have "out foxed" count less farmers. Because of the quick int elligence in their faces and their cunning night t ime raids, vulpine t oday almostalways describes a face or manner that suggest s a person capable of the same kind of sly scheming.

Quiz13-1 Quiz13-2 Quiz13-3 Quiz13-4 Quiz13-5 ReviewQuizzes13

CORD, from the Latin word for "heart ," t urns up in several common English words. So does it s Greek relat ive card-, which is familiar to us in words such as cardiac, "relat ing to the heart ."
 
==========accord                    (1) To grant . (2) To be in harmony; agree.


?
 What she t old police  under  quest ioning  didn't  accord  with  the  account s  of  the  other wit nesses.


A new federal law may accord with-or be in accordance with-the guidelines thata company has already established. The rowdy behavior of the hero Beowulf accords with Norse ideals of the early Middle Ages; but such behavior wouldn'thave been in accordance with the ideals of a lat er young lord from the same general region, Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet . Accord is also a noun, meaning "agreement ." Thus, we oft en hear of two countries signing a peace accord; and we also frequent ly hear of two things or people being "in accord with" each other.
 
==========concord                           (1) A stat e of agreement : harmony. (2) A formal agreement .


?
 In 1801 Napoleon signed a concord with the pope reestablishing the Catholic Church in France.


The root s of concord  suggest the meaning  "heart s t ogether." At the  very out set of the American Revolut ion, the t own of Concord, Massachuset t s, was the sit e of a famous bat t le- obviously not exact ly in keeping with it s name. It shares that name with the capital of New Hampshire and a few other t owns and cit ies, and Concordia, the original Latin word for "concord," is the name of several Lutheran universit ies. Today concord is a rather formal t erm, probably most oft en used to mean a specific agreement ; thus, two countries may sign a concord on mat t ers thathave led to trouble in the past .
 
==========cordial                   Warm, friendly, gracious.


?
 Aft er the meet ing, the president ext ended a cordial invitat ion to everyone for coffee ather own house.


Anything that is cordial comes from the heart . Cordial greet ings to friends on the street , or cordial relat ions bet ween two countries, are warm without being passionat e. Cordial is also a noun, which originally meantany st imulat ing medicine or drink that was thought to be good for the heart . Today a cordial is a liqueur, a sweet ened alcoholic drink with int erest ing flavoring. Cordials such as crme de menthe, Drambuie, or Benedict ine are alcoholic enough to warm the spirit s and the heart .
 
==========discordant
    Being at odds, conflict ing, not in harmony.


?
 The first discordant not e at dinner was struck by my cousin, when he claimed the president was only int erest ed in taking away our guns.


Discord, a word more common in earlier cent uries than t oday, means basically "conflict ," so discordant oft en means "conflict ing." The opinions of Supreme Court  just ices are frequent ly discordant ; just ices who disagree with the Court 's decision usually writ e a dissent ing opinion. Discordant is oft en used with a somewhat musical meaning, suggest ing thata single wrong not e or harmony has been heard in the middle of a performance-even though musical words such as chord act ually come from a different Latin word, meaning "cord" or "string" (a reference to the strings of ancient instrument s such as the lyre).
 
==========CULP comes from the Latin word for "guilt ." It s best -known appearance in English is probably in culprit, meaning someone who is guilt y of a crime.
 
==========culpable                           Deserving to be condemned or blamed.


?
 The company was found guilt y of culpable negligence in allowing the chemical wast e to leak int o the groundwat er.


Culpable normally means simply "guilt y." To a lawyer, "culpable negligence" is carelessness so serious that it becomes a crime-for instance, building a swimming pool in your suburban yard with no fence around it , so thata neighbor's child could fall in and drown. But degrees of culpability are important in the law; someone who int ended to do harm always faces a more serious challenge in court than someone who was merely careless.
 
==========exculpat e
   To clear from accusat ions of fault or guilt .


?
 The girls aren't proud of what they did that night , but they've been exculpat ed by wit nesses and won't be facing criminal charges.


Exculpate get s it s meaning from the prefix ex-, which here means "out of" or "away from." A suspect ed murderer may be exculpat ed by the confession of another person. And exculpatory evidence is the kind that defense lawyers are always looking for.
 
==========inculpat e            To  accuse  or  incriminat e; to show  evidence  of  someone's involvement in a fault or crime.


?
 It was his own father who finally inculpat ed him, though without int ending t o.


Inculpate is the opposit e of exculpate, justas inculpatory evidence is the opposit e of exculpatory evidence. By inculpat ing someone else, an accused person may manage to exculpat e himself. Through plea bargaining, the prosecut ion can oft en encourage a defendant to inculpat e his friends in ret urn for a light er sent ence.
 
==========mea culpa
      An admission of personal fault or error.


?
 The principal said his mea culpa at the school board meet ing, but notall the parent s were sat isfied.


Mea culpa, Latin for "through my fault ," comes from the prayer in the Catholic mass in which, back when Latin was st ill the language of the mass, one would confess to having sinned "mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa" ("through my fault , through my fault , through my most grievous fault "). When we say "Mea culpa" t oday, it means "I apologize" or "It was my fault ." But mea culpa is also common as a noun. So, for instance, a book may be a long mea culpa for the author's past treat ment of women, or an oil company may issue a mea culpa aft er a tanker runs aground.

==========dict ion                  (1) Choice of words, especially with regard to correct ness, clearness, or effect iveness. (2) Clarit y of speech.


?
 Our CEO is det ermined to appear in some TV ads, buthe first needs to work on his dict ion with a vocal coach.


When your English t eacher complains about some of the words you chose to use in an essay, she's talking about your dict ion. She may also use the t erm when comment ing on the word choices made by a poet , and why a part icular word was the best one possible in a part icular line. (Compare syntax.) But the second meaning of diction is justas common, and your English t eacher might use that one on you as well, especially when she's asked you to read something aloud and you mumble your way through it .
 
==========edict      (1) An official announcement  that  has the force of a law. (2) An order or command.


?
 In 1989 an edict by the leader of Iran pronouncing a death sent ence on a Brit ish novelist st unned the world.


Edict s are few and far bet ween in a democracy, since very few important laws can be made by a president or prime minist er act ing alone. But when a crisis arose in the Roman Republic, the senat e would appointa dictator, who would have the power to rule by edict . The idea was that the dictat or could make decisions quickly, issuing his edict s fast er than the senat e could act . When the crisis was over, the edict s were canceled and the dictat or usually ret ired from public life. Things are different t oday: dictat ors almostalways install themselves in power, and they never give it up.
 
==========jurisdict ion
     (1) The power or right to control or exercise authorit y. (2) The t errit ory where power may be exercised.


?
 Unluckily for the defendant s, the case fell within the jurisdict ion of the federal courtrather than the more t olerant stat e court .


Quest ions of jurisdict ion are generally t echnical legal mat t ers. The most important  ones include which court will hear a given case and which law-enforcementagency can get involved. Butalthough they may seem like mere t echnicalit ies, jurisdictional mat t ers somet imes t urn out to be all-important in the final out come. Jurisdict ion may depend on where you are (for example, in which stat e), on who you are (if you're a juvenile, for example, you may only be tried in juvenile court ), and on what the subject is (for example, cases involving the estat e left by someone who has died are dealt with in probat e court ).
 
==========dict um                      A formal and authoritat ive stat ement .


?
 Ithas long been a dict um of American foreign policy that the government doesn't negot iat e with kidnappers and t errorist s.


The word dictum is frequent ly used in philosophy, butalso in economics, polit ical science, and other fields. Almostany condensed piece of wisdom-"The perfect is the enemy of the good," "Buy low, sell high," "All polit ics is local," et c.-can be called a dict um. In the law, judges may oft en add to a writ t en opinion an obiter dictum, or "stat ement made in passing"-a strong stat ement that isn't direct ly relevant to the case being decided. If they're well thought outand eloquent , obiter dicta (not ice the plural form) may be referred to by lat er judges and lawyers for years aft erward.
 
==========GNI/GNO comes from a Greek and Latin verb meaning "t o know," and can be found at the root of know it self. Among other words built from this root , you may recognize ("know again") some and be ignorant of ("not know") others. But only an ignoramus would know absolut ely none of them.
 
==========cognit ive               (1) Having to do with the process of knowing, including awareness, judgment , and understanding. (2) Based on fact ual knowledge thathas been or can be gained by experience.


?
 A child isn'ta comput er; a third-grader's cognit ive abilit ies are highly dependent on his or her upbringing and happiness.


Cognit ive skills and knowledge involve the abilit y to acquire fact ual informat ion, oft en the kind of knowledge that can easily be t est ed. So cognition should be dist inguished from social, emot ional, and creat ive developmentand abilit y. Cognitive science is a growing field of st udy that deals with human percept ion, thinking, and learning.
 
==========agnost ic                A person who believes that whether God exist s is not known and probably cannot be known.


?
 Both of them were always agnost ics, butaft er they had children they start ed at t ending church again.


The words agnostic and agnosticism were coined around 1870 by the great English biologist T.
H. Huxley, who had just spenta decade defending the works of Charles Darwin against the at tacks of the church. Scient ist s oft en puta high value on evidence when arguing aboutreligion, and many agnostic thinkers believe thathuman minds simply aren't equipped to grasp the nat ure of God. Butagnost ics differ from atheists, who act ually claim that no God exist s and may even think they can prove it . You may have seen the similar word gnostic, the name for followers of certain religious sect s from around the t ime of Christ that sought spirit ual knowledge and reject ed the mat erial world. An increasing int erest in gnosticism t oday can be seen in the popular novels of Philip Pullman, Dan Brown, and Neil Gaiman.

In a famous myth, Zeus and Hermes visita village incognit o to t est the villagers. The seemingly poor travelers are t urned away from every household except that of Baucis and Philemon. This elderly couple, though very poor themselves, provide the disguised gods with a feast . When the gods finally reveal themselves, they reward the couple generously for their hospitalit y, but destroy the rest of the village.
 
==========prognosis
    (1) The chance of recovery from a given disease or condit ion. (2) A forecast or prophecy.


?
 The prognosis for a pat ient with chicken pox is usually excellent ; the prognosis for someone with liver cancer is t errible.


With it s prefix pro-, meaning "before," prognosis means basically "knowledge beforehand" of how a sit uat ion is likely to t urn out . Prognosis was originally a strict ly medical t erm, but it soon broadened to include predict ions made by expert s of all kinds. Thus, for example, economist s are constant ly offering prognoses (not ice the irregular plural form) about where the economy is going, and climat e scient ist s regularly prognosticate abouthow quickly the earth's at mosphere is warming.

==========GRAPH comes from the Greek verb graphein, "t o writ e." Thus, a biography is a writ t en account of someone's life (see BIO), a discography is a writ t en list of recordings on disc (records or CDs), and a filmography is a list of mot ion pict ures. But lot s of uses of -graph and - graphy don't mean lit erally "writ ing" (as in autograph or paragraph), but inst ead something more like "recording," as in photography, seismograph, or graph it self.
 
==========calligraphy
 The art of producing beaut iful handwrit ing.


?
 Calligraphy can be seen t oday in event invitat ions, logo designs, and st one inscript ions.


Kalli- is a Greek root meaning "beaut iful," and "beaut iful" in the case of calligraphy means art ist ic, st ylized, and elegant . Calligraphy has exist ed in many cult ures, including Indian, Persian, and Islamic cult ures; Arabic put s a part icularly high value on beaut iful script , and in Eastasia calligraphy has long been considered a major art . Calligraphers in the West use pens with wide nibs, with which they produce strokes of widely differing width within a single let t er.
 
==========hagiography
 (1) Biography of saint s. (2) Biography that  idealizes or idolizes.


?
 According to the new biography, which should really be called a hagiography, the former prime minist er doesn't seem to have done anything small-minded or improper in his ent ire life.


For those able to read, reading st ories of the lives of the saint s was a popular past ime for cent uries, and books collect ing short saint s' biographies were best sellers. These oft en included t errifically colorful st ories (about slaying dragons, magically traveling through space, et c.) that were perhaps a bit t oo good to be strict ly true, and aft er finding God not one of them ever did a single thing that wasn't saint ly-and some of them may nothave act ually exist ed. St ill t oday, hagiographic account s of the lives of polit icians and pop-cult ure stars are being writ t en, though there now seems to be a bigger audience for biographies that seek out the not -so-wholesome secret s of the person's life, somet imes even making up a few of them.
 
==========choreography                        (1) The art of composing and arranging dances and of represent ing them in symbolic notat ion. (2) The movement s by dancers in a performance.


?
 The reviews praised the show for it s eye-cat ching choreography, calling it the best element of the whole musical.


In ancient Greece, a choreia was a circular dance accompanied by a singing chorus. But the act ual notat ing of dances by means of symbols didn't begin unt il the 17th or 18th cent ury, when ballet developed int o a complex art form in France. The choreographer of a major ballet , which mightrun to an hour or more, will always record his or her work in notat ion, though choreographing a five-minut e segment for a TV talent show usually doesn'trequire any record atall.
 
==========lithograph                           A pict ure made by print ing from a flat surface (such as a smooth st one) prepared so that the ink will only st ick to the design that will be print ed.


?
 To make a lithograph, the art ist first draws an image, in reverse, on a fine-grained limest one or aluminum plat e.


Lithos is Greek for "st one," and a st one surface has tradit ionally been involved in lithography, though a metal plat e may take it s place t oday. The lithographic process was invent ed around 1796 and soon became the main method of print ing books and newspapers. Art ist s use lithography to produce print s (works int ended to be sold in many copies), and art lithographs somet imes resemble older t ypes of print s, including et chings, engravings, and woodcut s. Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Joan Mir, and M. C. Escher are among the many art ist s who have used lithography to produce important original works. Today lithographic print ing account s for over 40% of all print ing, packaging, and publishing.
 
==========ART comes from the Latin word for "skill." This reminds us that , unt il a few cent uries ago, almost no one made a strong dist inct ion bet ween skilled craft smanship and what we would now call "art ." And the word art it self could also mean simply "cleverness." The result is that this rootappears in some words where we might not expect it .
 
==========art ful                  (1) Skillful. (2) Wily, craft y, sly.


?
 It was an art ful solut ion: each side was pleased with the agreement , but it was the lawyer himself who st ood to make the most money off of it .


A writ er may produce an art ful piece of prose, one that 's clearly and elegant ly writ t en. The same writ er mightalso make an art ful argument , one that cleverly leaves out certain details and plays up others so as to make a stronger case. In the first instance, the prose is well craft ed; in the second, the argument might inst ead be called craft y. But even though both uses are correct , most of us st ill use artful somewhat different ly from artistic.
 
==========art ifact            A usually simple object made by human workmanship, such as a t ool or ornament , thatrepresent s a cult ure or a stage in a cult ure's development .


?
 Through the art ifact s found by archaeologist s, we now know a considerable amountabouthow the early Anasazi people of the Southwest lived.


One of the things that make humans unique is their abilit y to make and use t ools, and ever since the firstrough st one axes began to appear about 700,000 years ago, human cult ures have left behind art ifact s from which we've tried to draw a pict ure of their everyday life. The root s of art ifact mean basically "something made with skill"; thus, a mere st one that was used for pounding isn'tan art ifact , since it wasn't shaped by humans for it s purpose-unlike a ram's horn that was polished and given a brass mouthpiece and was blown as part of a religious rit ual.
 
==========art ifice                        (1) Clever skill. (2) A clever trick.


?
 By his cunning and art ifice, Iago convinces Othello that Desdemona has been unfaithful.


Artifice can be a tricky word to use. It combines the same root s as artifact, so it 's somet imes seen in descript ions of craft smanship ("The art ifice that went int o this jewelry can st ill ast ound us," "The chef had used all his art ifice to disguise the nat ure of the meat "). But it can also be used for many sit uat ions that don't involve physical mat erials ("They had got t en around the rules by a clever art ifice," "The art ifice of the plot is ingenious"). Like it s adject ive, artificial, artifice isn't necessarily either posit ive nor negat ive. But both words can make us slight ly uncomfortable if we like to think of simplicit y and nat uralness as important values.
 
==========art isan                          A skilled worker or craft sperson.


?
 At the fair, they saw examples of the best carving, pot t ery, and jewelry by local art isans.


Art isans aren't the same as artists, but it can somet imes be hard to t ell the difference. In the Middle Ages, art isans organized themselves int o guilds. In every cit y each group of art isans- weavers, carpent ers, shoemakers, and so on-had it s own guild, which set wages and prices, kept standards high, and prot ect ed it s members from out side compet it ors. In America, however, mostart isans have always been fiercely independent . Today, when fact ories produce almostall of our goods, art isans usually make only fine object s for those who can afford them. And we now even include food among the art isan's craft s, so you can buy artisanal cheeses, breads, and chocolat es-but probably not if you're wat ching your budget .

==========FORT  comes   from fortis,  Latin  for  "strong."  The  familiar  noun fort,  meaning  a  building strengthened against  possible at tacks, comes direct ly from it . And our verb comfortact ually means "t o give strength and hope t o."
 
==========fort ify                      To strengthen.


?
 Fort ified by a good night 's sleep and a big breakfast , they set off for the final 20 miles of their journey.


Medieval cit ies were fort ified againstat tack by high walls, and volunt eers may fort ify a levee againstan overflowing river by means of sandbags. Foods can be fort ified by adding vitamins, but "fort ified wines," such as sherry and port , have brandy (a "stronger" drink) rather than vitamins added to them. By adopt ing good exercise habit s, you can fort ify your body against illness. And fort ifying needn'talways be physical. An author's reputat ion may be fort ified by the success of his new book, or a prosecut or can fort ify a case againsta suspect by finding more evidence.
 
==========fort ificat ion
      (1) The building of military defenses to prot ecta place againstat tack. (2) A struct ure built to prot ecta place.


?
 The cit y's fort ificat ions had withst ood powerful assault s by catapult s, bat t ering rams, and tall siege t owers thatrolled up to release soldiers ont o the t op of the walls.


In the Middle Ages, many European cit ies were ent irely enclosed by st urdy walls, with walkways along the t op and t owers at int ervals, designed to make an invasion impossible. A wat er-filled dit ch, or moat , might  run alongside the wall for added defense. Such defenses t urned the ent ire cit y int o a fort, or fortress. Over the cent uries, fort ificat ions changed st eadily with the development of new weaponry. In World War I, the German fort ificat ion of the French coast included ant itank barriers, bunkers, minefields, and underwat er obstacles, but it wasn't enough to t urn back the immense force of the Allied invasion on D-day.
 
==========fort e
  Something that  a person does part icularly well; one's strong point .


?
 Her fort e was stat ist ics, and she was always ata disadvantage when the discussion t urned to public policy.


In the Middle Ages, swords were oft en known to break in bat t le, so the strongest part of a sword's blade-the part bet ween the handle (or hilt ) and the middle of the blade-was given a name, the forte. Today a fort e is usually a special strength. But no one can agree on how to pronounce it : all three pronunciat ions shown above are heard frequent ly. Part of the problem is confusion with the Italian musical t erm forte (always pronounced / f    r-t   /), meaning "loud."
 
==========fort it ude                         Mental strength thatallows one to face danger, pain, or hardship with courage.


?
 He's just t oo nice, and we worry thathe won'thave the fort it ude to deal with the monst ers in that office.


How many people know that the famous marble lions that guard the st eps of the New York Public Library in Manhat tan are named Pat ience and Fort it ude?
 In Latin, the qualit y of fortitudo combines physical strength, vigor, courage, and boldness, but the English fortitude usually means simply firmness and st eadiness of will, or "backbone." The philosopher Plat o long ago list ed four essent ial human virt ues-prudence (i.e., good judgment ), just ice (i.e., abilit y to be fair in balancing bet ween one's own  int erest s  and  others'),  t emperance  (i.e.,  moderat ion  or restraint ), and fort it ude, and in Christ ian tradit ion these became known as the four "cardinal virt ues."
 
==========CIS comes from the Latin verb meaning "t o cut , cut down, or slay." An incisor is one of the big front bit ing t eeth; beavers and woodchucks have especially large ones. A decision "cut s off" previous discussion and uncertaint y.
 
==========concise                      Brief and condensed, especially in expression or stat ement .


?
 Professor Childs's exam asked for a concise, one-page summary of the causes of the American Revolut ion.


Many st udent s think thatadding unnecessary sent ences with long words will make their writ ing more impressive. But in factalmost every reader values concision, since concise writ ing is usually easier to read, bet t er thought out , and bet t er organized-that is, simply bet t er writ ing. Words such as short don'thave the full meaning of concise, which usually means not just "brief" but "packed with informat ion."
 
==========excise                    To cut out , especially surgically.


?
 The ancient Minoans from the island of Cret e apparent ly excised the heart s of their human sacrifices.


Excise takes part of it s meaning from the prefix ex-, "out ." A writ er may excise long passages of a novel to reduce it to a reasonable length, or a film direct or may excise a scene that might give offense. A surgeon may excise a large cancerous t umor, or make a t iny excision to examine an  organ's t issue. Excise is also a noun, meaning a tax paid on something manufact ured and sold in the U.S. Much of what consumers pay for  t obacco  or alcohol product s go to cover the excise taxes that the stat e and federal government charge the manufact urers. But it 's only accidental that this noun is spelled like the verb, since it comes from a complet ely different source.
 
==========incisive                      Impressively directand decisive.


?
 A few incisive quest ions were all that was needed to expose the weakness  in  the prosecut or's case.


From it s root s, incise means basically "t o cut int o." So justas a doct or uses a scalpel to make an incision in the skin, an incisive remark cut s int o the mat t er athand. A good analyst makes incisive comment s abouta news st ory, cut t ing through the unimportant details, and a good crit ic incisively ident ifies a book's strengths and weaknesses.
 
==========precision
 Exact ness and accuracy.


?
 By junior year she was speaking with great er precision, searching for exact words in place of the crude, awkward language of her friends.


Many of us oft en use precision and accuracy as synonyms, but not scient ist s and engineers. For them, accuracy describes a part icular measurement -that is, how close it is to the truth. But precision describes a measurement syst em-that is, how good it is at giving the same result every t ime it measures the same thing. This may be why even nonscient ist s now oft en speak of "precision instrument s" for measuring, "precision landings" made by airplanes, "precision drilling" for nat ural gas, and so on.

==========Animal Words

apiary                           A place where bees are kept for their honey.


?
 Apple orchards are excellent sit es for apiaries, since the bees keep the  apple  trees product ive by pollinat ing them.


Beekeeping, or apiculture, is the care of honeybees that ensures that they produce more honey than they can use. An apiary usually consist s of many separat e beehives. The social life of a hive is strange and marvelous. The queen bee, who will become the mother of an ent ire colony, is act ually creat ed by being fed "royal jelly" while she is st ill only a larva. The t ens of thousands of worker bees are underdeveloped females; only a handful of the bees are male, and they do no work atall. The workers defend the hive by kamikaze means, st inging any intruder and dying as they do so. There's more drama in a quiet -looking apiary than the casual observer might not ice.
 
==========caper                    (1) A playful leap. (2) A prank or mischievous advent ure.


?
 For their caper in the girls' bathroom, all three seniors were suspended for a week.


Caper in Latin means "a male goat ." Anyone who has wat ched a young goat frolic in a field or clamber ont o the roof of a car knows the kind of crazy fun the English word caper -which is also a verb-is referring t o. A capriole is a backward kick done in midair by a trained horse. Capricorn, meaning "horned goat ," is a const ellat ion and one of the signs of the zodiac. And a capricious act is one that 's done with as lit t le thoughtas a frisky goat might give it .
 
==========equestrian
      Of or relat ing to horseback riding.


?
 The circus's equestrian act s, in which bareback riders performed daring acrobat ic feat s at op prancing horses, were her favorit es.


Equestrian comes from equus, Latin for "horse." Old stat ues of military heroes, like the famous one of General Sherman on New York's Fifth Avenue, are frequent ly equestrian. In these sculpt ures the man always sit s nobly upright on a horse, but the horse's stance varies; depending on whether the rider was killed in bat t le or survived, was vict orious or defeat ed, the horse tradit ionally stands with four, three, or two hooves on the ground. Equestrian stat ues have been popular through the cent uries, because unt il the 20th cent ury almost every officer in Europe and America was trained in equestrian skills and combat .
 
==========lupine                  Like a wolf; wolfish.


?
 Doct ors report ed that the boy showed lupine behavior such as snarling and bit ing, and walked with his knees bent in a kind of crouch.


Lupine comes from lupus, Latin for "wolf," and it s relat ed adject ive lupinus, "wolfish." Lupine groups  have  a  highly  organized   social   struct ure,  with   leaders   and   followers   clearly dist inguished; dogs, since they're descended from wolves, oft en show these lupine pat t erns when living in groups. St ories of children raised by wolves (the most famous being Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome) have generally been hard to prove, part ly because "wild" children lack human language abilit ies and can't describe their experiences. Lupine is also a noun, the name of a well-known garden flower, which was once thought to drain, or "wolf," the soil of it s nutrient s.
 
==========ovine                 Of, relat ing t o, or resembling sheep.


?
 In her vet erinary pract ice she specialized in ovine medicine, but oft en treat ed cows and pigs as well.


Sheep belong to the same family of mammals as goat s, ant elope, bison, buffalo, and cows. The genus Ovis includes at least five species, including the domest ic sheep. Some 12,000 years ago, in the area now known as Iraq, sheep became one of the firstanimals to be domest icat ed; only the dog is known to have been tamed earlier. At first , they were valued for their milk, skin, and meat (mut t on and lamb); not unt il about 1500 B.C. did the weaving of wool begin. Today a billion sheep are being farmed worldwide. The t erm ovine (which is a noun as well as an adject ive) is most ly used in scient ific and medical writ ing-which means you could impress your friends by dropping it int o a casual conversat ion.
 
==========ornithologist
     A person who st udies birds.


?
 John James Audubon, the great paint er of the birds of early America, was also a writ ing ornithologist of great importance.


The Greek root ornith- means "bird," so ornithology is the st udy of birds. Amat eur ornithology, usually called birding or birdwatching, is an extraordinarily popular past ime in America, where over 40 million people pursue it . Roger Tory Pet erson's many field guides have long been some of the amat eur ornithologist 's most useful t ools. Amat eurs oft en make essent ial contribut ions to serious ornithology, as in the annual Christ mas Bird Count , when t ens of thousands of birders fan outacross North and South America to produce a kind of census of all the species in the New World.
 
==========serpent ine
   Like a snake or serpent in shape or movement ; winding.


?
 The Great Wall of China, the great est construct ion of all t ime, wends it s serpent ine way for some 4,000 miles across the Chinese landscape.


A snake moves by curving and winding along the ground. Roads through the Pyrenees, the mountains that separat e Spain from France, t end to be serpent ine, curving back and forth on themselves up and down the st eep slopes. Serpentine has other meanings as well. As a noun, it 's the name for a soft green mineral, and also for the part y streamers you might throw at midnight on New Year's Eve. The serpentine belt under the hood in your car is the long, looping belt that most of the car's accessories-the AC, the power st eering, the alt ernat or, and so on
-depend on to get their power.
 
==========simian                         Having to do with monkeys or apes; monkeylike.


?
 Every aft ernoon the pale youth could be found wat ching the simian ant ics in the Monkey House with strange int ensit y.


The Latin word for "ape" is simia, which it self comes from simus, "snub-nosed." Simian is usually a scient ific word; thus, for instance, biologist s st udy simian viruses in the search for cures to AIDS and other diseases. But simian can be used by the rest of us to describe human behavior. Human babies oft en cling to their mothers in a simian way, and kids playing on a jungle gym may look like simians. But if you not ice thata friend has a simian st yle of walking or eat ing bananas, it might be best not to t ell him.

CRYPT comes from the Greek word for "hidden." To encrypta message is to encode it -that is, to hide it s meaning in code language. When a scient ific t erm begins with crypto-, italways means that there's something hidden about it .
 
==========crypt      (1) A room complet ely or part ly underground, especially under the main floor of a church. (2) A room or area in a large aboveground t omb.


?
 His old night mare was of being locked in a crypt with corpses as his only companions.


Hidden under the main floor of a great church is oft en a large room, oft en with a t omb as it s cent erpiece. Many major European churches were  built  over the  remains  of  a  saint -the Vat ican's great St . Pet er's Basilica is an example-and inst ead of having the coffin buried, it was oft en given it s spacious room below ground level. In a large aboveground t omb, or mausoleum, there may be several small chambers for individual coffins, also called crypt s; when the comic book Tales from the Crypt made it s firstappearance in 1950, it was this meaning that the authors were referring t o.
 
==========encrypt                     (1) To convert int o cipher. (2) To converta message int o code.


?
 Messages on the group's Web sit e are encrypt ed in code words to keep law-enforcementagent s from understanding them.


Codes aren'talways in another language; people have always been able to communicat e in ways that conceal their real meaning. In countries ruled by dictat ors, novelist s and playwright s have somet imes managed to encrypt their messages, conveying polit ical ideas to their audiences so that the authorit ies never not ice. But encryption t oday usually refers to a complex procedure performed on electronic t ext to make sure the wrong people-whether a nat ion's enemies or a business compet it or (most businesses use encrypt ion t oday)-can'tread it . And sensit ive data that merely resides on a company's own  comput ers  is  oft en encrypt ed as well.
 
==========crypt ic                    (1) Myst erious; puzzlingly short . (2) Act ing to hide or conceal.


?
 From across the room, Louisa threw Philip a crypt ic look, and he puzzled over what she was trying to t ell him.


Unt il the writ ing on the famous Roset ta St one was finally translat ed in the early 19th cent ury, Egypt ian hieroglyphic writ ing was ent irely crypt ic, it s meaning hidden from the modern world. In the same way, a crypt ic comment is one whose meaning is unclear, and a crypt ic not e may leave you wondering. Crypt ic coloring among plant s and animals act s like camouflage; so, for example, some moths thatare tast y to blue jays are cryptically colored to look like bugs that jays won't t ouch.
 
==========crypt ography                    (1)  Secret  writ ing. (2)  The  encoding  and  decoding  of messages.


?
 As a graduat e st udent in mathemat ics, she never dreamed she would end up working in crypt ography for the Defense Depart ment .


During World War I, crypt ography became an extremely complex science for both the Allied and Axis powers. The Allies managed to secret ly crack the code produced by the Nazis' Enigma machine, and thereby may have short ened the war by two years. The Axis cryptographers, on the other hand, never managed to crack the Americans' ult imat e code-the spoken languages of the Navajo and other American  Indians. In  the  age  of  comput ers, crypt ography has become almost unbelievably complex; it 's widely used in peacet ime in such areas as banking t elecommunicat ions.
 
==========AB/ABS comes to us from Latin, and means "from," "away," or "off." Abuse is the use of something in the wrong way. To abduct is to "lead away from" or kidnap. Aberrant behavior is behavior that "wanders away from" what is acceptable. But there are so many words that include these root s that it would be absurd to try to list them all here.
 
==========abscond To depart in secretand hide.


?
 They  discovered  the  next  morning  that  their  guest  had  absconded  with  most  of  the silverware during the night .


Wagner's massive four-part opera The Ring of the Nibelung begins with a dwarf absconding with gold which he t urns int o a magic ring. And in J. R. R. Tolkien's The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins absconds from Gollum's caves with the ring he has found, the ring Gollum calls "my precious"; what follows is detailed in the three-volume Lord of the Rings. (Tolkien knew Wagner's opera well.) A young couple mightabscond from their parent s to get married, but sooner or lat er they must face those parent s again.
 
==========abst emious
 Restrained, especially in the consumpt ion of food or alcohol.


?
 Her parent s had lefther two million dollars when they died, having been so abst emious for years that their neighbors all assumed they were poor.


Many 14th-cent ury monks lived by the Rule of St . Benedict , which demands an abst emious life of obedience and povert y. But notall monks could maintain such abst emious habit s. Chaucer's Canterbury Tales contains a portrait of a fat monk who is supposed to follow a vegetarian diet but inst ead is an enthusiast ic hunt er who loves a juicy swan best . He just ifies breaking the Rule by saying that it 's old-fashioned and thathe's just keeping up with modern t imes. Abstemious it self has  a slight ly  old-fashioned sound t oday, especially  in a country  where everyone is constant ly encouraged to consume.
 
==========abstract ion
      The considerat ion of a thing or idea withoutassociat ing it with a part icular example.


?
 All the ideas she came up with in class were abstract ions, since she had no experience of act ual nursing atall.


From it s root s, abstraction should mean basically "something pulled or drawn away." So abstractart is art thathas moved away from paint ing object s of the ordinary physical world in order to show something beyond it . Theories are oft en abstract ions; so a theory about economics, for instance, may "pull back" to take a broad view that somehow explains all of economics (but maybe doesn't end up explaining any of it very successfully). An abstract of a medical or scient ific art icle is a one-paragraph summary of it s cont ent s-that is, the basic findings "pulled out " of the art icle.
 
==========abstruse                        Hard to understand; deep or complex.


?
 In every class he fills the blackboard with abstruse calculat ions, and we usually leave more confused than ever.


The original meaning of abstruse, coming almost straight from the Latin, was "concealed, hidden." It 's easy to see how the word soon came to describe the kind of language used by those who possess certain kinds of expert knowledge (and don't necessarily want to share it with other people). Scient ific writ ing is oft en filled with the kind of abstruse special vocabulary that 's necessary for exactand precise descript ions. Unfort unat ely, the language of a science like quant um physics can make an already difficult subject even more abstruse to the average person.

==========PED- comes from the Greek word for "child." The same rootalso has the meaning "foot " (see
PED), but in English words it usually isn'thard to t ell the two apart .
 
==========pedagogy
    The art , science, or profession of t eaching.


?
 His own pedagogy is extremely original; it somet imes alarms school officials buthis st udent s love it .


Since in Greek agogos means "leader," a paidagogos was a slave who led boys to school and back, butalso taught them manners and t ut ored them aft er school. In t ime, pedagogue came to mean simply "t eacher"; t oday the word has an old-fashioned ring to it , so it oft en means a st uffy, boring t eacher. The word pedagogy, though, is st ill widely used, and oft en means simply "t eaching." And pedagogic training is what everyone majoring in educat ion receives.
 
==========pedant           (1) A formal, unimaginat ive t eacher. (2) A person who shows off his or her learning.


?
 At one t ime or another, every st udent encount ers a pedant who can make even the most int erest ing subject t edious.


It isn'talways easy to t ell a pedantic t eacher from one who is simply thorough. Some professors getan undeserved reputat ion for pedantry from st udent s who just don't like the subject much. Regardless of that , a pedant need not be a t eacher; anyone who goes around displaying his or her knowledge in a boring way can qualify.
 
==========pediatrician
   A doct or who specializes in the diseases, development , and care of children.


?
 Children in the U.S. usually see a pediatrician unt il they t urn at least 15 or 16.


Since iatros means "physician" in Greek (see IATR), words such as pediatric nat urally refer to "children's medicine." Pediatrics is a fairly new medical specialt y; unt il about 1900, children were considered small adult s and given the same medical treat ment , only milder. Benjamin Spock was the most famous pediatrician of the 20th cent ury, and his book Baby and Child Care changed the way millions of Americans raised their children.
 
==========encyclopedic
   (1) Of or relat ing to an encyclopedia. (2) Covering a wide range of subject s.


?
 Someone  with  the  kind  of  encyclopedic  knowledge  she  has  should  be  compet ing  on
Jeopardy.


In Greek, paidaea meant not simply "child-rearing" butalso "educat ion," and kyklios meant "general"; thus, an encyclopedia is a work broad enough to provide a kind of general educat ion. The world's most eminent general encyclopedia, the Encyclopaedia Britannica, is a huge work that covers every field of human knowledge. But encyclopedic doesn'thave to refer to books; it 's oft en used to describe the wide-ranging knowledge that certain t ypes of minds just can't st op acquiring.
 
==========TROP comes from the Greek tropos, meaning "t urn" or "change." The troposphere is the level of the at mosphere where most weather changes-or "t urns in the weather"-occur. And the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn are the lines of lat it ude where the sun is direct ly overhead when itreaches it s northernmostand southernmost point s, on about June 22 and December 22 every year-that is, the point where it seems to t urn and go back the other way.
 
==========tropism                       Aut omat ic movement by an organism unable to move about from place to place, especially a plant , that involves t urning or growing t oward or away from a st imulus.


?
 The new president was soon showing a tropism for bold act ion, a t endency that seemed more the result of inst inct than of careful thought .


In hydrotropism, a plant 's root s grow in the direct ion of increasing moist ure, hoping to obtain wat er. In phototropism, a plant (or  fungus)  moves t oward light , usually the sun-perhaps because, in the colder climat es where such plant s are usually found, concentrat ing the sun's warmth within the sun-seeking flower can creat e a warm and invit ing environment for the insect s that fert ilize it . In thigmotropism, the organism moves in response to being t ouched; most climbing plant s, for example, put out t iny t endrils that feel around for something solid and then at tach themselves or curl around it . When microbiologist s talk about tropism, however, they're oft en referring inst ead to the way a virus will seek outa part icular t ype of cell to infect . And when int ellect uals use the word, they usually mean a t endency shown by a person or group which they themselves might not even be aware of.
 
==========entropy                        (1) The decomposit ion of the mat t er and energy in the universe to an ult imat e stat e of inact ive uniformit y. (2) Chaos, randomness.


?
 The apart menthad been reduced to an advanced stat e of entropy, as if a t iny t ornado had t orn through it , shat t ering it s cont ent s and mixing the pieces t ogether in a crazy soup.


With it s Greek prefix en-, meaning "within," and the trop- roothere meaning "change," entropy basically means "change within (a closed syst em)." The closed syst em we usually think of when speaking of entropy (especially if we're not physicist s) is the ent ire universe. But entropy applies to closed syst ems of any size. Entropy is seen when the ice in a glass of wat er in a warm room melt s-that is, as the t emperat ure of everything in the room evens out . In a slight ly different t ype of entropy, a drop of food coloring in that glass of wat er soon spreads out evenly. However, when a nonphysicist uses the word, he or she is usually trying to describe a large-scale collapse.
 
==========heliotrope                      Any of a genus of herbs or shrubs having small whit e or purple flowers.


?
 A long bank of purple heliotrope lined the walkway, and her guest s were always remarking on the flowers' glorious fragrance.


Helios was the god of the sun in Greek mythology, and helio- came to appear in a number of sun-relat ed English words. The genus known as the heliotropes consist s of about 250 species; many are thought of as weeds, but the best -known species, garden heliotrope, is a popular and fragrant perennial thatresembles the forget -me-not . The heliotrope t ends to follow the sun-that is, t urn it s blossoms t oward the sun as it travels from East to West every day. But  the fact is, heliotropism-t urning t oward the sun-is common among flowers (and  even leaves), and some, like the sunflower, are more dramat ically heliotropic than the heliotrope. Those in the far North act ually use their petals to reflect the sun's heat ont o the flower's central ovary during the short growing season.
 
==========psychotropic
    Act ing on the mind.


?
 My mother is taking two drugs that may produce psychotropic side effect s, and I'm worried that they might be int eract ing.


Psychotropic is used almostalways to describe  substances  that  we  consume.  Such substances  are  more  numerous than you  might  think, and  some  have  been  known  for thousands  of years. Nat ive  American  religions,  for  example,  have  used  psychotropic substances derived from certain cact uses and mushrooms for cent uries. Caffeine and nicot ine can be called psychotropic. Psychotropic prescript ion drugs include ant idepressant s (such as Prozac) and tranquilizers (such as Valium). Any medicat ion that blocks pain, from aspirin to the anesthet ics used during surgery, can be considered a psychotropic drug. Even children are now prescribed psychotropic drugs, oft en to treatat t ent ion deficit disorder. And all recreat ional drugs are psychotropic. Psychoactive is a common synonym of psychotropic.

==========NEO comes from the Greek neos, meaning "new." Neo- has become a part of many English words. Some are easy to understand; for example, neo-Nazi. Some are less so; you might not immediat ely guess that neotropical means "from the tropics of the New World,"  or thata neophyte is a "newcomer." When William Ramsay discovered four new gases, he named them all using Greek root s thatat first glance might sound slight ly myst erious: argon ("idle"), krypton ("hidden"), xenon ("strange")-and neon ("new").
 
==========neoclassic                        Relat ing to a revival or adaptat ion of the st yles of ancient Greece and Roman, especially in music, art , or archit ect ure.


?
 He had always admired the paint ings of the French neoclassical mast ers, especially Poussin and Ingres.


In the art s and archit ect ure, a st yle thathas exist ed for a long t ime usually produces a react ion against it . So aft er the showy st yle of Europe's so-called baroque era (from about 1600 to the early 1700s), the react ion came in the form of the neoclassical movement , bringing order, restraint , and simpler and more conservat ive struct ures, whether in plays, sonatas, sculpt ures, or public buildings. It s inspirat ion was the art of ancient Greece and Rome-that is, of classical ant iquit y. Why classical?
 In Latin classicus meant "of the highest class," so in English classic and classical originally described the bestancient Greek and Latin lit erat ure, but soon came to mean simply "of ancient Greek and Rome," since these were already seen as the highestand best cult ures. Neoclassic generally describes art works from the 1700s or early 1800s (by the paint er David, the composer Mozart , the sculpt or Canova, et c.), butalso works from the 20th cent ury that seem to have been inspired by the ideals of Greece and Rome.
 
==========Neolithic
 Of or relat ing to the lat est period of the St one Age, when polished st one t ools were used.


?
 Around the Medit erranean, the Neolithic period was a t ime of trade, of st ock breeding, and of the first use of pot t ery.


Since lithos in Greek means "st one," the Neolithic period is the "new" or "lat e" period of the St one Age, in contrast to the Paleolithic period ("old" or "early" period-see PALEO) and the Mesolithic period ("middle" period) of the St one Age. The use of polished st one t ools came to different part s of the world at different t imes, but the Neolithic Age is usually said to begin around 9000 B.C. and to end around 3000 B.C., when the Bronze Age begins. The Neolithic is the era when the farming of plant s and animals begins, and when, as a result , humans first begin to creat e permanent set t lement s.
 
==========neoconservat ive
  A    conservat ive    who    favors    strongly encouraging democracy and the U.S. nat ional int erest in world affairs, including through military means.


?
 Many believed that foreign policy in those years had fallen int o the hands of the neoconservat ives, and that the war in Iraq was one result .


In the 1960s several well-known socialist int ellect uals, including Norman Podhoret z and Irving Krist ol, alarmed by growing polit ical extremism on the left , began to move in the other direct ion. Soon the t erm neoconservative (or neocon for short ) was being at tached to them. Rather than simply drift ing t oward the polit ical cent er, Podhoret z and Krist ol act ually moved far to the right , especially on the issue of maintaining a strong military stance t oward the rest of the world. The main magazine of neoconservatism became Podhoret z's Commentary; it  was lat er joined by the Weekly Standard, edit ed by Krist ol's son William. Not everyone agrees on how to define these t erms; st ill, it 's clear that t oday you don'thave to be a former liberal in order to be a neoconservat ive.
 
==========neonatal
  Of or relat ing to babies in the first month aft er their birth.


?
 The hospital's newestaddit ion is a neonatal int ensive-care unit , and newborns in crit ical condit ion are already being sent there from considerable distances.


Part ly  based  on  the  Latin natus,   "born," neonatal  means  "newly  born."  Neonatal  babies themselves are called neonates. Mosthospitals now offer neonatal screening, which is used to det ect diseases thatare treatable only if ident ified during the first days of life, and specialized neonatal nursing as well. But despit e spending much money on neonatal care, the U.S. st ill ranks lower than some much less wealthy countries (such as the Czech Republic, Port ugal, and Cuba) in infant mortalit y (infant deaths).
 
==========NOV comes from the Latin word novus, meaning "new." To renovate an old house is to "make it new again"-that is, put it back in t ip-t op shape. The long-running PBS show Nova keeps it s large audience up to dat e on what 's new in the world of science. And when the Brit ish king sent Scot t ish set t lers to a large island off Canada's At lant ic coast in the 17th cent ury, he named it Nova Scotia, or "New Scot land."
 
==========novice                   (1) One who has no previous training or experience in a specific field or act ivit y; beginner. (2) A new member of a religious order who is preparing to become a nun or monk.


?
 It 's hard to believe thata year ago she was a complet e novice as a gardener, who couldn't ident ify a cornstalk.


Among the ancientromans, a novice (novicius) was usually a newly import ed slave, who had to be trained in his or her dut ies. Among Catholics and Buddhist s, if you desire to become a priest , monk, or nun, you must serve as a novice for a period of t ime, oft en a year (called your novitiate), before being ordained or fully professing your vows. No mat t er what kind of novice you are-at comput ers, at writ ing, at polit ics, et c.-you've gota lot to learn.
 
==========novel                (1) New and notresembling something formerly known or used. (2) Original and striking, especially in concept ion or st yle.


?
 His t echniques for dealing with these dist urbed young people were novel, and they caught the at t ent ion of the inst it ut e's direct or.


If someone t ells you that you've come up with a  novel idea  or a  novel int erpretat ion  of something, it 's probably a compliment : not everyone is capable of original thinking. But not everything new is t erribly worthwhile; a novelty, for example, is oft en a cut e (or maybe just silly) lit t le object that you might put on a display shelf in your house. It may seem surprising that the familiar noun novel is relat ed as well. In the 14th  cent ury, Italian  writ ers  began  writ ing collect ions of short tales, each of which they called a novella because itrepresent ed a new lit erary form; from this word, three cent uries lat er, the English coined the noun novel.
 
==========innovat ion                           (1) A new idea, device, or method. (2) The introduct ion of new ideas, devices, or methods.


?
 "Smooshing" bit s of candy int o ice cream while the cust omer wat ched was just one of his innovat ions that lat er got copied by chains of ice-cream out let s.


Innovation is a word that 's almostalways connect ed with business. In business t oday, it 's almosta rule thata company that doesn't innovate is dest ined for failure. The most importantand successful businesses were usually start ed by innovators. And company managers should always at least list en to the innovative ideas of their employees.
 
==========supernova
(1)  The  explosion  of  a  star  that  causes  it to become extremely bright . (2) Something that explodes int o prominence or popularit y.


?
 Aft er exploding, a nova leaves a "whit e dwarf" which may explode again in the fut ure, buta supernova destroys the ent ire star.


A nova, despit e it s name, isn'tact ually a "new" star, butrather one that wasn't not iced unt il it exploded, when it may increase in bright ness by a million t imes before ret urning to it s previous stat e a few days lat er. A supernova is far larger; a star in it s supernova stat e may emita billion  t imes as much lightas previously. Aft er a few weeks it begins to dim, unt il it event ually ceases to exist ; it 's oft en replaced by a black hole. (Though remains that were shot out int o space may survive; those of a great supernova seen in A.D. 1054 are now known as the Crab Nebula.) All this may serve as a warning to those human stars whose fame explodes t oo rapidly; supernovas of this kind have somet imes vanished by the following year.

A stat e may impose new taxes on luxury it ems or cigaret t es, and the federal government somet imes imposes trade restrict ions on another country to punish it .

Since juxta means "near" in Latin, it 's easy to see how juxtapose was formed. Juxtaposing is generally done for examinat ion or effect . Int erior designers constant ly make decisions about juxtaposing object s and colors for the best  effect . Juxtaposing two video clips showing the different things thata polit ician said about the same subjectat two different t imes can be an effect ive means of crit icizing. The juxtaposition of two similar X-rays can help medical st udent s dist inguish bet ween two condit ions that may be hard to t ell apart . And advert isement s frequent ly juxtapose "before" and "aft er" images to show a thrilling transformat ion.
 
==========transpose                      (1) To change the posit ion or order of (two things). (2) To move from one place or period to another.


?
 She rechecked the phone number and discovered that two digit s had been transposed.


Though transposing two digit s can be disastrous, transposing two let t ers in a word oft en doesn't mat t er t oo much. (You can prboalby raed t ihs set nence wit ohut t oo mcuh t oruble.) Transposing two words or sounds-as in "Can I sew you to another sheet ?
"-has been a good source of humor over the years. Doct ors somet imes discover that something in the body
-a nerve, an organ, et c.-has been transposed, or moved away from it s proper place. For musicians, transposing means changing the key of a piece; if you can do this ata moment 's not ice, you've been well trained.
 
==========superimpose
   To put or place one thing over something else.


?
 Using transparent sheet s, she superimposes t errit ory boundaries on an out line of Africa, showing us how these changed in the lat e 19th and early 20th cent ury.


Superimposition was one of the magical effect s employed by early filmmakers. Using "mirror shot s," with semitransparent mirrors setat 45 angles to the scene, they would superimpose shadowy images of ghost s or scenes from a charact er's past ont o scenes from the present . Superimposing your own ideas on something, such as a hist orical event , has to be done carefully, since your ideas may change whenever you learn something new about the event .
 
==========TEN, from the Latin verb tenere, basically means "hold" or "hold on t o." A tenant is the "holder" of an apart ment , house, or land, but not necessarily the owner. A lieutenant governor may "hold the posit ion" ( "serve in lieu") of the governor when necessary.
 
==========t enure                 (1) The amount of t ime thata person holds a job, office, or t it le. (2) The right to keep a job, especially the job of t eacher or professor.


?
 I know two assistant professors who are so worried about being denied t enure this year that they can't sleep.


Tenure is aboutholding on to something, almostalways a job or posit ion. So you can speak of someone's 30-year t enure as chairman, or someone's brief t enure in the sales manager's office. But tenure means something slight ly different in the academic world. In American colleges and universit ies, the best (or luckiest ) t eachers have tradit ionally been grant ed a lifet ime appoint ment known as t enure aft er about six years of t eaching. Almost nobody has as secure a job as a tenured professor, but get t ing t enure can be difficult , and most of them have earned it .
 
==========t enacious
  St ubborn or det ermined in clinging to something.


?
 He was known as a t enacious report er who would stay with a st ory for months, risking his health and somet imes even his life.


Success in most fields requires a t enacious spiritand a drive to achieve. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the ent ertainment business. Thousands of act ors and actresses work tenaciously to build a TV or film career. But without talent or beaut y, tenacity is rarely rewarded, and only a few become stars.
 
==========t enable                         Capable of being held or defended; reasonable.


?
 She was depressed for weeks aft er her professor said thather theory wasn't t enable.


Tenable means "holdable." In the past it was oft en used in a physical sense-for example, to refer to a cit y thatan army was trying to "hold" militarily againstan enemy force. But nowadays it 's almostalways used when speaking of "held" ideas and theories. If you hold an opinion but evidence appears that complet ely contradict s it , your opinion is no longer t enable. So, for example, the old ideas that cancer is infect ious or that being bled by leeches can cure your whooping cough now seem untenable.
 
==========t enet                   A widely held principle or belief, especially one held in common by members of a group or profession.


?
 It was soon obvious that the  new owners didn't share the t enet s that the company's founders had held to all those years.


A tenet is something we hold, but not with our hands. Tenet s are oft en ideals, butalso oft en stat ement s of faith. Thus, we may speak of the t enet s of Islam or Hinduism, the t enet s of West ern democracy, or the t enet s of the scient ific method, and in each case these t enet s may combine element s of both faith and ideals.

MONO comes from the Greek monos, meaning "along" or "single." So a monorail is a railroad thathas only one rail; a monocle is an old-fashioned eyeglass thata gent leman used to squeeze int o his eye socket ; a monotonous voice seems to have only one t one; and a monopoly put s all ownership of a t ype of product or service in the hands of a single company.
 
==========monogamous
    Being married to one person or having one mat e ata t ime.


?
 Geese, swans, and most other birds are monogamous and mat e for life.


American marriage is by law monogamous; people are permit t ed to have only one spouse (husband or wife) ata t ime. There are cult ures with laws that permit marriage to more than one person ata t ime, or polygamy. Some Islamic countries permit polygamy, as do some African tribes. In this country the Mormons were polygamous unt il 1890, when they were forced to adopt monogamy by the unsympathet ic federal government .
 
==========monocult ure
    (1) The cult ivat ion of a single crop to the exclusion of other uses of land. (2) A cult ure dominat ed by a single element .


?
 Monocult ure is pract iced on a vast scale in the American Midwest , where nothing but corn can be seen in the fields for hundreds of square miles.


The Irish Potat o Famine of 1845-49, which led to the deaths of over a million people, result ed from the monocult ure of potat oes, which were destroyed by a t errible blight , leaving farmers nothing else to eat . Almost every tradit ional farming societ y has pract iced crop rotat ion, the plant ing of different crops on a given piece of land from year to year, so as to keep the soil from losing it s qualit y. But in the modern world, monocult ure has become the rule on the largest commercial farms, where the same crop can be plant ed year aft er year by means of the int ensive use of fert ilizers. Modern monocult ure has produced huge crops; on a large scale, it permit s great efficiency in plant ing, pest control, and harvest ing. But many expert s believe this all comes ata huge cost to the environment .
 
==========monolithic
(1) Appearing to be a huge, feat ureless, oft en rigid whole. (2) Made up of mat erial with no joint s or seams.


?
 The sheer monolithic rock face of Yosemit e's El Capitan looks impossible to climb, but it s cracks and seams are enough for experienced rock climbers.


The -lith in monolith comes from the Greek lithos, "st one," so monolith in it s original sense means a huge st one like those at St onehenge. What 's so impressive about monoliths is that they have no separat e part s or pieces. To the lone individual, any huge inst it ut ion or government  bureaucracy can seem monolithic. But  the truth may be different : The former
U.S.S.R. once seemed monolithic and indestruct ible to the West , but in the 1990s it crumbled int o a number of independentrepublics.
 
==========monotheism
        The worship of a single god.


?
 Christ ian monotheism finally triumphed in the Roman Empire in A.D. 392, when the worship of pagan gods and goddesses was forbidden.


The monotheism of the ancienthebrews had to combat the polytheism (worship of many gods) of the surrounding peoples from the earliest t imes. As the Bible relat es, several t imes in their hist ory the Hebrews t urned away from their monotheistic beliefs and accept ed foreign gods, such as those import ed by King Solomon. Each t ime their own God would punish them for their disloyalt y, and the people of Israel would ret urn to monotheism. Today Judaism shares it s monotheism with two much larger religions, Christ ianit y and Islam.
 
==========UNI comes from the Latin word for "one." A uniform is a single design worn by everyone. A united group has one single opinion, or forms a single unit. A unitard is a one-piece combinat ion leotard and t ight s, very good for skat ing, skiing, dancing-or riding a one-wheeled unicycle.
 
==========unicameral
     Having only one lawmaking chamber.


?
 In China, with it s unicameral syst em of government , a single group of legislat ors meet s to make the laws.


Unicameral means "one-chambered," and the t erm almostalways describes a governing body. Our federal legislat ure, like those of most democracies, is bicameral, with two legislat ive (lawmaking) bodies-the Senat e and the House of Representat ives. And except for Nebraska, all the stat e legislat ures are also bicameral. So why did the nat ion decide on a bicameral syst em?
 Part ly in order to keep some power out of the hands of ordinary vot ers, who the Founding Fathers didn't complet ely trust . For thatreason, the original Const it ut ion stat es that senat ors are to be elect ed by the stat e  legislat ures; not  unt il 1914, aft er passage  of  a Const it ut ional amendment , did we first cast direct vot es for our senat ors.
 
==========unilat eral
   (1) Done by one person or part y; one-sided. (2) Affect ing one side of the body.


?
 The Japanese Const it ut ion of 1947 includes a unilat eral reject ion of warfare as an opt ion for their country.


The world is a smaller place than it used to be, and we get uncomfortable when a single nat ion adopt s a policy of unilateralism-that is, act ing independent ly with lit t le regard for what the rest of the world thinks. A unilat eral invasion of another country, for instance, usually looks like a grab for power and resources. But occasionally the world welcomes a unilat eral act ion, as when the U.S. announced unilat eral nuclear-arms reduct ions in the early 1990s. Previously, such reduct ions had only happened as part of bilateral ("t wo-sided") agreement s with the old Soviet Union. Multilateral agreement s, on issues such as climat e change, oft en involve most of the world's nat ions.
 
==========unison
(1) Perfectagreement . (2) Sameness of musical pit ch.


?
 Unable to read music well enough to harmonize, the village choir sang only in unison.


This word usually appears in the phrase "in unison," which means "t ogether, at the same t ime" or "at the same musical pit ch." So an excit ed crowd responding to a speaker may shout in unison, and a group of demonstrat ors may chant in unison. The old church music called Gregorian chant  was writ t en to be sung in unison, with no harmonizing voices, and kindergart en kids always sing in unison (at least when they can all find the same pit ch). In a similar way, an aerobics class moves in unison following the instruct or, and a group or even a whole t own may work in unison when everyone agrees on a common goal.
 
==========unitarian
      Relat ing or belonging to a religious group that believes that God exist s only in one person and stresses individual freedom of belief.


?
 With his unitarian t endencies, he wasn't likely to get int o fight s over religious beliefs.


Unitarianism, originally a sect of Christ ianit y believing in a single or unitary God, grew up in 18th-cent ury England and developed in America in the early 19th cent ury. Though they believe in Christ 's t eaching, they reject the idea of the three-part Trinit y-God as father, son, and holy spirit -and thus deny that Christ was divine, so some  people  don't  consider  them  truly Christ ian. In this cent ury the Unitarians joined with the Universalist Church, a movement founded on a belief in universal salvat ion-that is, the saving of every soul from damnat ion aft er death. Both have always been liberal and fairly small; t oday they countabouthalf a million members. Withouta capital let t er, unitarian refers simply to belief in a unitary God, or in unity within some nonreligious syst em.

TERM/TERMIN GEO SPHER VERT MORPH FORM DOC/DOCT TUT/TUI DI/DUP BI/BIN
Number Words
Quiz15-1 Quiz15-2 Quiz15-3 Quiz15-4 Quiz15-5 ReviewQuizzes15

TERM/TERMIN comes from the Latin verb terminare, "t o limit , bound, or set limit s t o," and the noun terminus, "limit or boundary." In English, those boundaries or limit s t end to be final. A term goes on for a given amount of t ime and then ends, and to terminate a sent ence or a meet ing or a ballgame means to end it .
 
==========t erminal
(1) Forming or relat ing to an end or limit . (2) Fatal.


?
 She knows she's in the lat e stages of a t erminal illness, and has already drawn up a will.


A t erminal disease ends in death. If you're terminally bored, you're "bored to death." For many st udent s, a high-school diploma is their t erminal degree (others finish college before terminating their educat ion). A bus or train terminal is the endpoint  of the line. A comput er t erminal was originally the endpoint of a line connect ing to a central comput er. A t erminal ornament may mark the end of a building, and t erminal punct uat ion ends this sent ence.
 
==========indet erminat e
      Not precisely det ermined; vague.


?
 The police are looking for a tall whit e bearded man of indet erminat e age who should be considered armed and dangerous.


When you determine something, you decide on what it is, which means you put limit s or boundaries on it s ident it y. So something indet erminat e lacks ident ifying limit s. A mut t is usually  the product of indet erminat e breeding, since at least  the  father's  ident it y  is  generally  a myst ery. A paint ing of indet erminat e origins is normally less valued than one with the paint er's name on it . And if negot iat ions are left in an indet erminat e stat e, nothing has been decided.
 
==========int erminable
    Having or seeming to have no end; t iresomely drawn out .


?
 The preacher was making another of his int erminable pleas for money, so she snapped off the TV.


Nothing is lit erally endless, except maybe the universe and t ime it self, so interminable as we use it  is always an exaggerat ion. On an unlucky day you might  sit through an int erminable meet ing, have an int erminable drive home in heavy traffic, and wat ch an int erminable film-all in less than 24 hours.
 
==========t erminus (1) The end of a travel rout e (such as a rail or bus line), or the stat ion at the end of a rout e. (2) An extreme point ; t ip.


?
 They've been tracking the t erminus of the glacier for 20 years, in which t ime ithas retreat ed 500 yards.


This word comes straight from Latin. In the Roman empire, a t erminus was a boundary st one, and all boundary st ones had a minor god associat ed with them, whose name was Terminus. Terminus was a kind of keeper of the peace, since wherever there was a t erminus there could be no argument s about where your propert y ended and your neighbor's propert y began. So Terminus even had his own fest ival, the Terminalia, when images of the god were draped with flower garlands. Today the word shows up in all kinds of places, including in the name of numerous hot els worldwide built near a cit y's railway t erminus.
 
==========GEO comes from the Greek  word  for  "Earth." Geography  is  the  science  that  deals  with feat ures of the Earth's surface. Geologists st udy rocks and soil to learn about the Earth's hist ory and resources. Geometry was originally about measuring port ions of the Earth's surface, probably originally in order to det ermine where the boundaries of Egypt ians' farms lay aft er the annual flooding by the Nile River.
 
==========geocentric
     Having or relat ing to the Earth as the cent er.


?
 He claims that , if you aren'ta scient ist , your consciousness is most ly geocentric for your ent ire life.


The idea that the Earth is the cent er of the universe and that the sun revolves around it is an ancient one, probably dat ing back to the  earliest  humans. Not  unt il 1543  did  the  Polish astronomer Copernicus publish his calculat ions proving that the Earth act ually revolves around the sun, thus replacing the geocentric model with a heliocentric model (from Helios, the Greek god of the sun). But geocentrism remains central to various religious sect s around the world, and st ill t oday one in five adultamericans believes the sun revolves around the Earth.
 
==========geophysics              The  science  that  deals  with  the  physical  processes  and phenomena occurring especially in the Earth and in it s vicinit y.


?
 Locat ed in the heart of oil and gas country, the universit y offers a degree in geophysics and many of it s graduat es go straight to work for the oil and gas industry.


Geophysics applies the principles of physics to the st udy of the Earth. It deals with such things as the movement of the Earth's crustand the t emperat ures of it s int erior. Another subject is the behavior of the st ill-myst erious geomagnetic field. Some geophysicists seek out deposit s of ores or petroleum; others specialize in earthquakes; st ill others st udy the wat er beneath the Earth's surface, where it collect s and how it flows.
 
==========geostat ionary
   Being  or having  an  orbit  such  that  a  sat ellit e remains in a fixed posit ion above the Earth, especially having such an orbitabove the equat or.


?
 It was the science-fict ion writ er Arthur C. Clarke who first conceived of a set of geostat ionary sat ellit es as a means of worldwide communicat ion.


We don't give much thought to geostat ionary sat ellit es, but many of us rely on them daily. Anyone who wat ches sat ellit e TV or list ens to sat ellit e radio is dependent on them; the weather phot os you see on TV are taken from geostat ionary sat ellit es; and military informat ion gathering via sat ellit e goes on quiet ly day aft er day. (Though the sat ellit es that provide GPS service for your car or cell phone act ually aren't geostat ionary, since they orbit the Earth t wice a day.) By 2009 there were about 300 geostat ionary sat ellit es in operat ion, all of them moving atan alt it ude of about 22,000 miles. Since they hover above the same spot on Earth, your receiving dish or ant enna doesn'thave to t urn in order to track them.
 
==========geothermal
  Of, relat ing t o, or using the nat ural heat produced inside the Earth.


?
 Geothermal power plant s convert underground wat er or st eam to electricit y.


Geothermal  comes  part ly  from  the  Greek thermos,  "hot " (see THERM/THERMO). Most geothermal electricit y is provided by power plant s sit uat ed in areas where there is significantact ivit y of the Earth's great t ect onic plat es-oft en the same areas where volcanoes are found. Buthot wat er from deep underground may be used by cit ies far from volcanoes to heat buildings or sidewalks. And a newer source of geothermal energy relies on a less dramat ic kind of heat : Individual homeowners can now install heat pumps that take advantage of the 50- 60 t emperat ure of the soil near the surface to provide heat ing in cold weather (and air- condit ioning in the warm months). These very small-scale geothermal syst ems may event ually supply more useful energy than the large power plant s.

==========SPHER comes from the Greek word for "ball." A ball is it self a sphere, as is the ball that we call Earth. So is the atmosphere, and so are several other invisible "spheres" that encircle the Earth.
 
==========spherical                         Relat ing to a sphere; shaped like a sphere or one of it s segment s.


?
 The girls agreed that the spacecrafthad been deep blue and perfect ly spherical, and that it s alien passengers had resembled large praying mant ises.


Something spherical is like a sphere in being round, or more or less round, in three dimensions. Apples and oranges are both spherical, for example, even though they're never perfect ly round. A spheroid has a roughly spherical shape; so an ast eroid, for instance, is oft en spheroidal- fairly round, but lumpy.
 
==========strat osphere                        (1) The part  of the earth's at mosphere that  ext ends from about seven to about 30 miles above the surface. (2) A very high or the highestregion.


?
 In the celebrit y strat osphere she now occupied, a fee of 12 million dollars per film was a reasonable rat e.


The strat osphere (strato- simply means "layer" or "level") lies above the earth's weather and most ly changes very  lit t le. It  contains  the  ozone  layer, which  shields  us  from  the  sun's ultravioletradiat ion except where it 's been harmed by manmade chemicals. The levels of the atmosphere are marked part icularly by their t emperat ures; stratospheric t emperat ures rise only to around 32-very moderat e considering that t emperat ures in the troposphere below may descend to about -70 and those in the ionosphere above may rise to 1000.
 
==========biosphere                        (1) The part of the world in which life can exist . (2) Living things and their environment .


?
 The moon has no biosphere, so an art ificial one would have to be construct ed for any long- t erm stay.


The lithosphere is the solid surface of the earth (lith- meaning "rock"); the hydrosphere is the earth's wat er (hydro- means "wat er"), including the clouds and wat er vapor in the air; and the atmosphere is the earth's air (atmos- meaning "vapor"). The t erm biosphere can include all of these, along with the 10 million species of living things they contain.

==========hemisphere                      Half a sphere, especially half the global sphere as divided by the equat or or a meridian.


?
 A sailor who crosses the equat or from the northern to the southern hemisphere for the first t ime is tradit ionally given a special init iat ion.


Hemisphere includes the prefix hemi-, meaning "half." The northern and southern hemispheres are divided by the equat or, the circle halfway bet ween Earth's two poles. The east ern and west ern hemispheres aren't divided so exact ly, since there are no poles in the Earth's east - west dimension. Oft en the dividing line is said to be the "prime meridian"-the imaginary north- south line thatruns through Greenwich, England, from which all longit ude is calculat ed (it self being the 0 meridian). But for simplicit y's sake, the east ern hemisphere is oft en said to include all of Europe, Africa, Australia, and Asia, while the west ern hemisphere contains North and South America and a great deal of ocean.
 
==========VERT comes from the Latin verb vertere, meaning "t o t urn" or "t o t urn around." Vertigo is the dizziness that  makes it  seem as if everything is t urning around you. And an advertisement t urns your at t ent ion to a product or service.
 
==========divert                (1) To t urn from one purpose or course to another. (2) To give pleasure to by distract ing from burdens or distress.


?
 The farmers had successfully divert ed some of the river's wat er to irrigat e their crops during the drought .


The Roman circus was used to provide diversion for it s cit izens-and somet imes to divert their at t ent ion from the government 's failings as well. The diversion was oft en in the form of a fight
-men pit t ed against lions, bears, or each other-and the audience was sure to see blood and death. A diverting evening these days might inst ead include wat ching the same kind of mayhem on a movie screen.
 
==========convert er             A device that changes something (such as radio signals, radio frequencies, or data) from one form to another.


?
 She was so indifferent to t elevision that she hadn't even boughta convert er, and her old TV sat there useless unt il she finally lugged it down to the recycling cent er.


Convert ers come in many forms. Travelers to foreign countries who bring along their electric razors or hair dryers always pack a small electric convert er, which can change direct current to alt ernat ing current or vice versa. In 2009 millions of  Americans  bought  digital-analog convert ers, small box-shaped devices that change the new broadcast digital signal to the analog signal that older TV set s were made to receive. A catalytic converter is the pollut ion- control device at tached to your car's exhaust syst em that convert s pollutant s such as carbon monoxide int o harmless form.
 
==========avert                   (1) To t urn (your eyes or gaze) away or aside. (2) To avoid or prevent .


?
 General Camacho's announcement of lower food prices avert ed an immediat e worker's revolt .


Sensit ive people avert their eyes from gory accident s and scenes of disast er. But the accident or disast er might it self have been avert ed if someone had been alert enough. Negot iat ors may averta strike by all-night talks. In the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, it seemed that  nuclear catastrophe was barely avert ed. Aversion means "dislike or disgust "-that is, your feeling about something you can't stand to look at .
 
==========revert                 (1) To go back or ret urn (t o an earlier stat e, condit ion, sit uat ion, et c.). (2) To be given back to (a former owner).


?
 Control of the Panama Canal Zone, firstacquired by the U.S. in 1903, revert ed to the local government in 1999.


Since the prefix re- oft en means "back" (see RE-), the basic meaning of revert is "t urn back." Revertand reversion  oft en  show up  in legal document s, since  propert y is oft en  given to another person on the condit ion that it will revert to the original owner at some fut ure dat e or when something happens (usually the death of the second person). In nonlegal uses, the word t ends to show up in negat ive cont ext s. Many reformed drinkers, for example, event ually revert to their old ways, and most people revert to smoking at least once or t wice before succeeding in quit t ing for good.

==========MORPH comes from the Greek word for "shape." Morph is it self an English word with a brand- new meaning, which was needed when we began to digitally alt er phot ographic images or shapes to make them move or transform themselves in oft en ast onishing ways.
 
==========amorphous                           Withouta definit e shape or form; shapeless.


?
 Picking up an amorphous lump of clay, she molded it swift ly int o a rough human shape.


According to the Greek myths of the creat ion, the world began in an amorphous stat e; and the Bible stat es that , at the beginning, "the earth was without form, and void." Most of us have had night mares that consist most ly of justa looming amorphous but t errifying thing. A plan may have so lit t le detail that crit ics call itamorphous. And a new word may appear to name a previously amorphous group of people, such as yuppie in 1983 and Generation X six years lat er.
 
==========anthropomorphic
          (1) Having or described as having human form or trait s. (2) Seeing human trait s in nonhuman things.


?
 The old, diseased tree had always been like a companion to her, though she didn'treally approve of such anthropomorphic feelings.


Anthropomorphic means a couple of different things. In it s first sense, an anthropomorphic cup is a cup in the shape of a human, and anthropomorphic gods are human in appearance-like the Greek and Roman gods, for example, even though Socrat es and others believed that their fellow Greeks had creat ed the gods in their own image rather than the other way around. In it s second sense, the animal charact ers in Aesop's fables are anthropomorphic since they all have human feelings and thought s even though they don't look like humans. Thus, when the fox calls the grapes sour simply because they're out of reach, it 's a very human response. Thousands of years aft er Aesop, anthropomorphism is st ill alive and well, in the animal st ories of Beatrix Pot t er, George Orwell's Animal Farm, and hundreds of cart oons and comic strips.
 
==========metamorphosis
   (1)   A    physical    change,   especially    one supernat urally caused. (2) A developmental change in an animal that occurs aft er birth or hat ching.


?
 Day by day the class wat ched the gradual metamorphosis of the tadpoles int o frogs.


Many ancient myths end in a metamorphosis. As Apollo is chasing the nymph Daphne, she calls on her river-god father for help and he t urns her int o a laurel tree to save her. Out of anger and jealousy, the goddess Athena t urns the marvelous weaver Arachne int o a spider that will spin only beaut iful webs. But nat ural substances may also metamorphose, or undergo metamorphosis. Heatand pressure over thousands of years may event ually t urn t iny organisms int o petroleum, and  coal  int o  diamonds.  And  the  most  beloved  of  nat ural metamorphoses (not ice how this plural is formed) is probably the transformat ion of cat erpillars int o but t erflies.
 
==========morphology
   (1) The st udy of the struct ure and form of plant s and animals.
(2) The st udy of word format ion.


?
 The morphology of the mouthpart s of the different mayfly species t urns out to be closely relat ed to what they feed on and their methods of eat ing.


Within the field of biology, morphology is the st udy of the shapes and arrangement of part s of organisms, in order to det ermine their funct ion, their development , and how they may have been shaped by evolut ion. Morphology is part icularly important in classifying species, since it can oft en reveal how closely one species is relat ed to another. Morphology is st udied within other sciences as well, including astronomy and geology. And in language, morphology considers where words come from and why they look the way they do.
 
==========FORM is the Latin root meaning "shape" or "form." When you march in formation, you're moving in ordered pat t erns. And a formula is a standard form for expressing informat ion, such as a rule writ t en in mathemat ical symbols, or the "Sincerely yours" that oft en ends a let t er.
 
==========format     (1) The shape, size, and general makeup of something. (2) A general plan, arrangement , or choice of mat erial.


?
 The new thesaurus would  be  published in  three format s: as a  hardcover book, a  large paperback, and a CD-ROM.


Format is a word that seems to gain more uses with every decade. Tradit ionally, people used the word simply to refer to the design of a book or newspaper page, but t oday that 's only one of it s many meanings. TV news shows seem to change their format , or general form, as oft en as their anchorpeople, and show t ypes such as sit uat ion comedy and crime drama are oft en called format s. When a radio stat ion gives up playing pop music to became a talk stat ion, it 's said to be swit ching format s. In the electronic age, formathas also become widely used as a verb; thus, organizing electronic data for st orage or other special uses is called format t ing (or reformatting).
 
==========conform (1) To be similar or ident ical; to be in agreement or harmony. (2) To follow ordinary standards or cust oms.


?
 My family was t oo odd to really conform to the lit t le t own's ideas about proper behavior, but it didn't seem to bother our neighbors t oo much.


Conform, with it s prefix con-, "with" or "t ogether," means basically "t o adopt the form of those around you." Thus, employee behavior must  usually conform with basic company policies. A certain philosophy may be said to conform with American values (even if we somet imes have a hard t ime agreeing on exact ly what those are). And a Maine Coon cat or a Dandie Dinmont  t errier must conform to it s breed requirement s in order to be regist ered for breeding purposes. Being  a conformist  is  usually  a  safe  bet ;  being  a nonconformist,  who  ignores  societ y's standards and the whole idea of conformity, can be a bit dangerous butalso somet imes more fun.
 
==========formalit y
   (1) An established cust om or way of behaving that is required or standard. (2) The following of convent ional rules.


?
 The bride and groom want ed a small, int imat e wedding withoutall the usual formalit ies.


Formal behavior follows the proper forms or cust oms, and informal behavior feels free to ignore them. The formalit y of a dinner part y is indicat ed by such formalit ies as invitat ions, required dress, and full table set t ings. Legal formalit ies, or t echnicalit ies, may t urn out to be all-important even if they oft en seem minor. America requires fewer formalit ies than many other countries (in Germany, for example, you may know someone for years before using his or her first name), but even in relaxed sit uat ions Americans may be observing invisible formalit ies.
 
==========format ive                         (1) Giving or able to give form or shape; construct ive. (2) Having to do with important growth or development .


?
 She lived in Venezuela during her format ive years and grew up speaking both Spanish and English.


What ever gives shape to something else may be called format ive: for example, the Grand Canyon is a product of the format ive power of wat er, and the aut omobile was a huge format ive influence on the design of America's cit ies. But it usually applies to some kind of shaping that isn't physical. An ambit ious plan, for example, goes through a format ive stage of development . The format ive years of the U.S. included experimentat ion with various forms of government . And the most important format ive experiences in our own lives t end to take place in the first 20 years or so.

==========DOC/DOCT comes from the Latin docere, which means "t o t each." So, for instance, a doctor was originally a highly educat ed person capable of instruct ing others in a field-which usually wasn't medicine.
 
==========doctrine                        (1) Something that is taught . (2) An official principle, opinion, or belief.


?
 According to the 19th-cent ury doctrine of "papal infallibilit y," a pope's official stat ement s on mat t ers of faith and morals must be regarded as the absolut e truth.


The original doctrines were those of the Catholic Church, especially as taught by the so-called doctors (religious scholars) of the Church. But t oday a doctrine can come from many other sources. Old and established legal principles are called legal doctrine. Tradit ional psychiatrist s st ill follow the doctrines of Sigmund Freud. Communist doctrine in the 1920s and '30s was oft en the t eachings of Lenin, which were then regarded in the Soviet Union as almost sacred.
U.S. president s have given their names to doctrines as well: In 1823 the Monroe Doctrine stat ed that the Unit ed Stat es would oppose European influence in the Americas, and in 1947 the Truman Doctrine held thatamerica would support free countries against enemies out side and inside.
 
==========docent                        (1) Teacher, lect urer. (2) A person who leads guided t ours, especially through a museum.

 Visit ors to Istanbul's great Topkapi Museum oft en decide they need to hire an English- speaking docent .


The t it le of docent is used in many countries for whatamericans would call an associat e professor-that is, a college or universit y t eacher who has been given t enure (see tenure) buthasn't yetachieved the rank of full professor. But in the U.S. a docent is a guide who works ata museum, a hist orical sit e, or even a zoo or a park. Docent s are usually volunt eers, and their services are oft en free of charge.
 
==========doctrinaire
Tending to apply  principles  or  theories  without  regard  for pract ical difficult ies or individual circumstance.


?
 She had never taken a doctrinaire approach to t eaching, since educat ion theories didn'talways mat ch the realit y of instruct ing 25 lively st udent s.


Someone doctrinaire st icks closely to official doctrines or principles. A doctrinaire judge will give ident ical sent ences to everyone found guilt y of a part icular crime. A doctrinaire feminist may treatall men as if they were ident ical. A doctrinaire economist might call for a single solut ion for the economic problems in all countries, regardless of their social and cult ural hist ory. As you might guess, the word isn't oft en used in posit ive cont ext s.
 
==========indoctrinat e                        (1) To t each, especially basics or fundamentals. (2) To fill someone with a part icular opinion or point of view.


?
 In the Army's basic training, sergeant s have 11 weeks to indoctrinat e their new recruit s with army at t it udes and discipline.


Indoctrinate simply means "brainwash" to many people t oday. We frequent ly hear, for example, of religious cult s that indoctrinat e their members to give up their freedom and individualit y and to work hard only for a leader's goals. But it s meaning wasn't originally negat ive atall. And the fact is that every societ y indoctrinat es it s young people with the values of it s cult ure; in the
U.S. we t end to be indoctrinat ed to love freedom, to be individuals, and to work hard for success, among many other things. But we now rarely use indoctrinate (or it s noun, indoctrination) in a posit ive way; inst ead we usually st ick to the simpler and safer teach or instruct.
 
==========TUT/TUI comes from a Latin verb meaning "t o look aft er," and in English the root generally shows up in words that include the meaning "guide," "guard," or "t each"-such as tutor, the name for a privat e t eacher who guides a st udent (or tutee) through a subject .
 
==========t ut orial                        (1) A class for one st udent  or a small group of st udent s. (2) An instruct ional program that gives informat ion abouta specific subject .

Tut orials with live t ut ors are useful for both advanced st udent s and struggling ones. Many comput er programs include electronic t ut orials to help the new user get used to the program, leading him or her through all it s funct ions, oft en by means of pict ures and short videos. Buta really difficult program may st ill require a real-life t ut or to be fully underst ood.
 
==========t uit ion                         (1) The act of t eaching; instruct ion. (2) The cost of or payment for instruct ion.


?
 As she happily flipped through her college catalogs, her parent s sat quiet ly but uneasily calculat ing the t otal t uit ion cost s.


The sense of tuition meaning "t eaching" or "instruct ion" is most ly used in Britain t oday. In the U.S., tuition almostalways means the cost s charged by a school, college, or universit y for that t eaching. Those cost s have t ended to rise atan alarming rat e in recent years. Around 2010 a st udent could receive a four-year college educat ion (t uit ion, room, and board) atan inexpensive public universit y for less than $50,000, but mighthave to pay more than $200,000 atan expensive privat e college or universit y.
 
==========int uit ion

?
 She scoffed at the not ion of "women's int uit ion," special powers of insightand understanding in personal relat ions that women are supposed to have.


Intuition is very close in meaning to instinct. The momenta man ent ers a room you may feel you know intuitively or inst inct ively everything abouthim-that is, you may intuithis basic personalit y. Highly rat ional people may try to ignore their int uit ion and insist on being able to explain everything they think, butart ist s and creat ive thinkers oft en t end to rely on their intuitive sense of things. Int uit ion can be closely relat ed to their imaginat ion, which seems to come from somewhere justas myst erious. Some psychologist s claim that the left brain is mainly involved in logical thinking and the right brain in int uit ive thinking; but the brain is t erribly complex, and even if there's some truth to this idea, it 's not t erribly obvious how to make use of it .

 Already in her first job, she not iced a dichot omy bet ween the theories she'd been taught in college and the realit ies of professional life.


In the modern world there's a dichot omy bet ween fastand int ense big-cit y life and the slower and more relaxed life in the country. But the dichot omy is nothing new: the Roman poethorace was complaining about it in the 1st cent ury B.C.

==========dimorphic                          Occurring in two dist inguishable forms (as of color or size).


?
 One of a birder's challenges is ident ifying birds of the less colorful sex in dimorphic species.


Dimorphism varies great ly in the animal kingdom. Among mammals, the male is generally larger than the female, but other differences in appearance t end to be modest . But birds are usually not iceably dimorphic, with the male being the more colorful sex; when we imagine a pheasant , a mallard, a cardinal, or a peacock, we're almostalways pict uring the male rather than the female. Among spiders the sit uat ion is  oft en reversed. The golden orb-weaver spider, for example, is spectacularly dimorphic: the female may be 20 t imes the size of the male, and she usually ends up eat ing him, somet imes even while he's mat ing with her. Many sea creat ures, including many fish, take care of gender problems by simply changing from one sex int o the other.
 
==========duplex          (1)  Having  two principal  element s;  double.  (2)  Allowing  electronic communicat ion in two direct ions at the same t ime.


?
 The upper floor of their splendid duplex apart menthad a panoramic view of Paradise Park.


Duplex can describe a confusing variet y of things, depending on the t echnical field. Most of us use itas a noun: a duplex can be either a t wo-family house or a t wo-st ory apart ment . In comput er science and t elecommunicat ions, duplex (or full-duplex) communicat ion can go in both direct ions at once, while half-duplex communicat ion can go only one way ata t ime. In other areas, just translat e duplex as "double" and see if the sent ence makes sense.
 
==========duplicit y                          Decept ion by pret ending to feel and act one way while act ing in another.


?
 By the t ime Jackie's duplicit y in the whole mat t er had come to light , she had left t own, leaving no forwarding address.


The Greek god Zeus oft en resort ed to duplicit y to get whathe want ed, and most of the t ime whathe want ed was some woman. His duplicit y usually involved a disguise: he appeared to Leda as a swan, and to Europa as a bull. Somet imes he had to be duplicitous to getaround his wife, Hera. Aft er he had had his way with Io and was about to get caught , he t urned her int o a cow to avoid Hera's anger.
 
==========BI/BIN also means "t wo" or "double." A bicycle has two wheels, and binoculars consist of two lit t le t elescopes. Bigamy is marriage to two people at once. And a road built through the middle of a neighborhood bisects it int o two pieces.
 
==========bipart isan
Involving members of two polit ical part ies.


?
 The president named a bipart isan commission of three Republicans and three Democrat s to look int o the issue.


Partisan means basically "belonging to a part y," so something bipart isan combines two part ies. Since the Unit ed Stat es t oday operat es with a t wo-part y syst em of government (even though the Const it ut ion says nothing about part ies atall), legislat ion oft en musthave some bipart isan support in order to pass int o law. Bipart isan commit t ees review legislat ion, compromising on some point s and removing or adding others in order to make the bill more agreeable to both part ies and make bipart isan support from the ent ire legislat ure or Congress more likely.
 
==========binary                      (1)  Consist ing  of  two things  or  part s; double. (2)  Involving  a  choice bet ween two alt ernat ives.


?
 The Milky Way contains numerous binary stars, each consist ing of two stars orbit ing each other.


Binary has many uses, most of them in t echnical t erms. Almostall comput er soft ware, for example, is writ t en in binary code, which uses only two digit s, 0 and 1, 0 standing for a low- voltage impulse ("off") and 1 standing for a high-voltage impulse ("on"). All informat ion is kept in this form. The word "HELLO," for example, looks like this: 1001000 1000101 1001100 1001100 1001111.
 
==========biennial                     (1) Occurring every two years. (2) Cont inuing or last ing over two years.


?
 The great biennial show of new art in Venice usually either puzzles or angers the crit ics.


Biennial convent ions, celebrat ions, compet it ions, and sport s event s come every two years. Biennials are plant s that live two years, bearing flowers and fruit only in the second year. (Carrot s and sugar beet s are two examples; since we're only int erest ed in their root s, we don't waitanother year to see their flower and fruit .) In contrast , semiannual means "t wice a year." But no one can agree whether biweekly means "t wice a week" or "every two weeks," and whether bimonthly means "t wice a month" or "every two months." Maybe we should st op using both of them unt il we can decide.

 Our bipolar Earth spins on an axis that ext ends bet ween the North and South Poles.


Magnet s are always bipolar: one pole at tract s and the other repels or drives away. And the Cold War arms race was bipolar, since it mainly involved the opposing powers of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. But the word is encount ered most oft en t oday in bipolar disorder, the newer name of what used to be called manic-depressive illness, in which the person t ends to swing bet ween the two extremes, or poles, of high int ensit y and deep depression, with depression being the main condit ion. Though an extremely serious illness, bipolar disorder can oft en be controlled by the drug lithium.

TOP CENTR/CENTER DOM OMNI HOL/HOLO RETRO TEMPOR CHRON TRI NumberWords
Quiz16-1 Quiz16-2 Quiz16-3 Quiz16-4 Quiz16-5 ReviewQuizzes16

TOP comes from topos, the Greek word for "place." A topic is a subjectrather than a place; to the Greeks, the original word meant more or less "about one place or subject (rather than another)"-which just goes to show that it 's notalways easy to trace a word's meaning from it s root s.
 
==========t opical             (1) Designed for local applicat ion to or treat ment of a bodily part . (2) Referring to the t opics of the day.


?
 If the t opical oint ment doesn't work on the rash, the doct or will prescribe an ant ibiot ic pill.


Like a t opical medicine, a t opical reference or st ory applies to something specific, focusing on a topic that 's current ly in the news. TV comedians oft en use t opical humor, making jokes abouta current ly popular movie or the lat est polit ical scandal-if possible, one that just broke that same day. Topical humor has a short lifespan, though, because the news keeps changing and  the new hot t opics just keep coming. The medical meaning of topical stays closer to the meaning of the root , since it describes something that 's putright on the place that seems to need it .
 
==========ect opic                         Occurring or originat ing in an abnormal place.


?
 A pacemaker was installed to correcther ect opic heart beat .


Ectopic is a medical word that means basically "out of place." An ect opic kidney is locat ed in an abnormal posit ion. In pat ient s with an ect opic heart beat , the electrical signals that trigger the heart muscles originat e in an abnormal area of the heart . But ectopic most commonly describes a pregnancy in which the fert ilized egg begins to develop in an area out side the ut erus, such as in a fallopian t ube; such pregnancies may lead to serious problems if  not treat ed.
 
==========ut opian                         Relat ing to an imaginary place in which the government , laws, and social condit ions are perfect .


?
 Some of the new mayor's support ers had got t en increasingly unrealist ic, and seemed to expect that she could t urn the cit y int o a ut opian communit y.


In 1516 Thomas More published Utopia, a descript ion of a fict ional island in the At lant ic with an ideal societ y, in order to draw a sharp contrast with the disorderly polit ical sit uat ion of his own t ime. He creat ed the name from topos ("place") and ou, Greek for "no," since he was well aware that nowhere so perfect was likely to exist on earth. People have long dreamed of creat ing ut opian communit ies; some of them have joined communes, societ ies where other idealist s like themselves have chosen to live in a cooperat ive way according to certain principles. Not just communes but plans of all kinds have been labeled ut opian by crit ics. But we can dream, can't we?

 
==========t opography
    (1) The art of showing the nat ural and man-made feat ures of a region on a map or chart . (2) The feat ures of a surface, including both nat ural and man-made feat ures.


?
 Planning the expedit ion involved careful st udy of the region's t opography.


Topography combines top- with graph-, a root meaning "writ e" or "describe." The t opography of the Sahara Desert feat ures shift ing sand dunes and dry, rocky mountains. A topographic (or topo) map not only shows the surface feat ures of a region butalso indicat es the cont ours and approximat e alt it ude of every locat ion, by means of numerous curving lines, each indicat ing a single elevat ion. In other words, it shows a "three-dimensional" pict ure on a t wo-dimensional surface. Topo maps are commonly used by hikers, surveyors, government workers, and engineers, among other people.
 
==========CENTR/CENTER comes from the Greek kentron and the Latin centrum, meaning "sharp point " or "cent er point of a circle." A centrifuge is a spinning machine that throws things out ward from the center; the apparent force that pushes them out ward is called centrifugal force.
 
==========eccentric                           (1)  Not  following  an  established  or  usual st yle  or  conduct . (2) Straying from a circular path; off-cent er.


?
 She keeps a dozen stray cat s in her house and is rather eccentric, buther neighbors say she's very pleasantand complet ely harmless.


An eccentric wheel spins unevenly, and an eccentric person is similarly a lit t le off-cent er. Most eccentricities are inoffensive to others, and some may even do some good. For instance, riding a bicycle to work might be considered eccentric by some people, but it 's good exercise and it cut s down on pollut ion. Some eccentrics are justahead of their t ime.
 
==========epicent er
    (1) The locat ion on the earth's surface direct ly above the focus of an earthquake. (2) The cent er or focus of act ivit y.


?
 The destruct ion caused by Mexico Cit y's earthquake was ext ensive because the cit y was at the quake's epicent er.


The meaning of epi- in epicenter is "over," so the epicent er of an earthquake lies over the cent er or "focus" of the quake. Epicenter can also refer to the cent ers of things that may seem in their own way as powerful-though notas destruct ive-as earthquakes. Wall Street , for example, might be said to lie at the epicent er of the financial world.
 
==========egocentric
Overly concerned with oneself; self-cent ered.


?
 He's brilliant but complet ely egocentric, and the only things he'll talk aboutare his own life and work.


Ego means "I" in Latin. To an egocentric person, I is the most important word in the language. Greatart ist s and writ ers are oft en egocentrics; such people can be hard to live with, though their egocentricity, an unfort unat e side effect of their talent , is oft en forgiven. But ordinary egocentricit y, which shows up as selfishness, lack of sympathy, and lack of int erest in other people, usually has lit t le to do with any personal talent or success.
 
==========ethnocentric
    Marked by or based on the at t it ude that  one's own group is superior to others.


?
 Some reviewers crit icized the ethnocentric bias that came  through  in  the  way the  film portrayed immigrant s.


The Greek word ethnos means "nat ion" or "people." So ethnocentricity shows it self in a lack of respect for other ways of life, and an ethnocentric person feels thathis or her own nat ion or group is the cult ural cent er of the world. Ethnocentric describes the kind of person  who behaves badly when traveling in foreign countries, oft en called an "Ugly American" (from a book and movie of the same name). Whenever you hear someone making fun of the way a foreigner speaks English, justremember that it 's the foreigner, not the person laughing athim, who act ually can speak a foreign language.

==========DOM comes from the Latin domus, "house," and dominus, "mast er," and the two are indeed relat ed. In the Bible, King Ahasuerus, angered by his queen's disobedience, proclaims that "every man is to be mast er of his own house," and in the Roman empire no one doubt ed that this was how it was meant to be. A domain is the area where a person has authorit y or is dominant-but we no longer think of a house as the domain of a single dominant member of a family.
 
==========dominion
   (1) An area over which one rules; domain. (2) Supreme authorit y.


?
 The Roman empire had dominion over the ent ire Medit erranean, which the Romans called
mare nostrum, "our sea."


The ruler of a region has dominion over it , and the area it self may be called the ruler's dominion. In the days of the Brit ish Empire, England had dominion over many countries throughout the world. Though Canada has been quit e independent of Great Britain since the 19th cent ury, it was generally referred to as the Dominion of Canada in official document s unt il at least the 1950s. The word has an old-fashioned sound t oday, and probably shows up in hist ory books, hist orical novels, and fantasy video games more oft en than in discussions of modern nat ions.
 
==========predominant
      Great er in importance, strength, influence, or authorit y.


?
 The predominant color of the desert landscape was a rust y brown.


Something predominant stands outabove all the rest . The predominant theme in an essay is the one that predominates-the main idea that the writ er want s to express. (Not ice the difference bet ween the adject ive and the verb; be sure not to spell the adject ive with an -ate ending.) The word is widely used in many fields. For example, the predominant language of Swit zerland is German; the predominant cause of obesit y in children is a bad diet ; and your predominantreason for want ing a larger vocabulary may be to simply be a bet t er-educat ed person-though the posit ive effect s of a large vocabulary on one's romant ic life are well known.
 
==========domineering
      Tending to control the behavior of others in a bossy manner.


?
 His mother was a domineering t ype, and not even his st epfather dared do anything withouther permission.


To be domineering is to behave like a lord. (The word lordly doesn't express quit e the same thing.) Someone who t ells you what you can wear or what friends you can spend t ime with could be called domineering; so could someone who always decides what you're going to do with your free t ime. Those of us who grow up with a domineering parent usually flee as soon as we're old enough.
 
==========dominat ion                           (1) Supremacy or power over another. (2) The exercise of governing or controlling influence.


?
 The region was under the dominat ion of a single nat ion, even though ithadn't yet invaded it s neighbors.


Domination may sound like something that 's achieved by military force. The t otal dominat ion of Europe, for example, has never been achieved: The Roman empire could never fully dominate the northern Germanic tribes; Napoleon couldn't conquer Spain; and although Adolf Hit ler was briefly dominant over most of the cont inent , he never managed to overpower England. But the word's earliestappearances don't necessarily involve physical force; Chaucer, for instance, speaks of a mind's dominat ion by strong drink. So we may observe thata great t ennis player has cont inued his dominat ion of the world's court s this season, or that the dominat ion of popular music by rock and roll was obvious by the end of the 1950s.
 
==========OMNI comes from the Latin word omnis, meaning "all." So in English words, omni- can mean "in all ways," "in all places," or "without limit s." An omnidirectional ant enna, for example, is one thatreceives or sends radio waves equally well in all direct ions. And Omni by it self has been used repeat edly as a brand name for things as differentas a hot el chain and a science magazine.
 
==========omnivore
An animal that eat s both plant s and other animals.


?
 If we're all nat ural omnivores, she keptasking herself, then why wouldn'ther t oddler eatanything but cashews and peanut but t er unt il the age of four?



Human beings seem to be classic omnivores. Originally living as "hunt er-gatherers," we hunt ed and fished when possible butalso gathered nut s, berries, fruit s, seeds, and root s for much of our diet . We're physically well suit ed for both tasks; our hands are perfect for picking things, and our build is ideal for running down even the fast est game animals because of our great stamina. Some 10,000 years ago humans began pract icing agricult ure involving both animals and plant s. The other omnivorous mammals include chimpanzees, pigs, opossums, porcupines, bears, raccoons, skunks, chipmunks, mice and rat s, and skunks. But even many mammals classed as carnivorous (see VOR) t urn out to be capable of shift ing to plant foods when necessary.
 
==========omnipot ent
 Having complet e or unlimit ed power; all-powerful.


?
 Whatreally scares these men is the night mare of an omnipot ent stat e, and they think that with their guns they'll be able to keep the government 's forces at bay when the t ime comes.


If you know that potens means "power" in Latin (see POT), it 's nothard to guess the meaning o f omnipotent. In Christ ian services and prayers, the Latin omnipotens is translat ed as "almight y" and always applied to God. But omnipotence in a government or ruler is nat urally a bit scary; as a Brit ish lord observed a cent ury ago, "Power t ends to corrupt , and absolut e power corrupt s absolut ely." So democracies do their best to make omnipot ence impossible.
 
==========omnibus
Of or including many things.


?
 Eager to go home for vacat ion, Senat e leaders assembled an omnibus bill to t ie up the loose ends on dozens of unrelat ed project s.


In Latin, omnibus means "for all." So an omnibus bill in Congress packages several measures t ogether, an omnibus survey may poll the public on a wide range of issues, and an omnibus edit ion of a writ er's st ories may bring t ogether justaboutall of them. As a noun, omnibus used to mean a large vehicle for public transportat ion-that is, "for all" who could pay the fare-butaround 1900 the word began to be short ened to simply bus.
 
==========omniscient                   Knowing   everything;  having   unlimit ed   understanding   or knowledge.


?
 Brought up in a strict Christ ian family, he knew thatan omniscient God was wat ching him every second of his life.


Omniscience is something thata t otalitarian stat e may try to achieve by means of informers, cameras, and monit oring of electronic communicat ion. If your English t eacher t ells you thata novel has an "omniscient narrat or,'' she means that the voice t elling the st ory isn't one of the charact ers but inst ead knows what each of them is doing and thinking, with the point of view constant ly shift ing from one to another.

==========HOL/HOLO, meaning "whole," comes from the Greek word holos, with the same meaning. The root can be found in catholic. When capitalized, Catholic refers to the worldwide Christ ian church based in Rome, which  was  once  the  "whole"-that  is, the  only-Christ ian  church. Without the capital let t er, catholic means simply "universal" or, when describing a person, "broad in one's int erest s or tast es."
 
==========holist ic                        Relat ing to or concerned with wholes or with complet e syst ems rather than with the analysis of, treat ment of, or dissect ion int o part s.


?
 Environmental scient ist s t end to be holist ic in their views, even when they're only st udying a t iny pat ch of ground.


"The whole is great er than the sum of it s part s" expresses the essence of holism, a t erm coined by the great South African general and stat esman Jan Smut s in 1926. Holism generally opposes the West ern t endency t oward analysis, the breaking down of wholes  int o part s somet imes to the point that "you can't see the forest for the trees." Holism is an important concept in the sciences and social sciences, and especially in medicine. Holist ic medicine tries to treat the "whole person" rather than focusing t oo narrowly on single sympt oms. It emphasizes the connect ions bet ween the mind and the body, avoids the overuse of drugs, and has borrowed such pract ices from East ern tradit ions as acupunct ure and yoga.
 
==========hologram
    A  three-dimensional  image  reproduced  from  a  pat t ern  of int erference produced by a beam of radiat ion such as a laser.


?
 When holograms are used for data st orage, the ent ire bulk of the st orage mat erial can be used rather than just it s surface.


A hologram is a pict ure of a "whole" object , showing it in three dimensions. We've all seen cheap holographic images on credit cards and ID cards (where they help prevent copying). Far more impressive are large holograms that take the form of a ghost ly 3-D moving figure that you can walk around to see from all angles. Holograms were invent ed in  1947  but  only perfect ed aft er the invent ion of the laser in 1960. Today they're used in such t echnologies as compact -disc players and checkout scanners, and holograms can be creat ed of the inside of live  int ernal  organs to permit  doct ors to examine  the  organs  in  great  detail. And  soon t elevisions with hologram t echnology may enable us to wat ch in "3-D."
 
==========Holocene
Of, relat ing t o, or being the present geologic epoch.


?
 As the Holocene epoch began, the glaciers were swift ly retreat ing, forest s were taking over the bare land, and human beings were moving northward again in large numbers.


To geologist s, we live t oday in the Holocene epoch, the period that began about 10,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, when humans first began pract icing agricult ure. But what does Holocene have to do with "whole"?
 Well, in geological language, the Holocene epoch follows the Paleocene ("remot ely recent "), the Eocene ("early recent "), the Oligocene ("scarcely recent "), the Miocene ("less recent "), the Pliocene ("more recent "), and the Pleistocene ("mostrecent ") epochs-so the Holocene is the "wholly recent " period of geological t ime.
 
==========holocaust                          (1) (usually capitalized) The mass slaught er of European civilians and especially Jews by the Nazis during World War I. (2) A thorough destruct ion involving ext ensive loss of life, especially through fire.


?
 Her parent s had escaped the Holocaust in Poland by fleeing int o the forestand surviving there with hundreds of others for two years.


The Greek word holokaustos means "burnt whole." For the early Jews who followed the laws given in the first books of the Bible, a holocaust was a sacrifice to God, the burning on an altar of a lamb, goat , or young bull. The word is used about 200 t imes in the tradit ional Greek version of the Old Testament , though itrarely appears in English translat ions. In the 1700s holocaust began to be used to refer to the mass destruct ion of life. But no mass murder in West ern hist ory ever approached the scale achieved by the Nazis. As many as 6 million Jews may have died at their hands; when the slaught er of non-Jews is included, the number of murdered vict ims may have amount ed to over 15 million.
 
==========RETRO means "back," "backward," or "behind" in Latin. Retro in English is generally a prefix, buthas also become a word in it s own right , usually used to describe old st yles or fashions.
 
==========retroact ive
    Int ended to apply or take effectata dat e in the past .


?
 The fact that the tax hike was retroact ive annoyed the public the most .


We normally think of t ime as constant ly moving forward. Since retroactive seems to defy t ime's forward movement , retroact ive taxes, laws, and regulat ions are oft en seen as part icularly obnoxious and  unfair.  (See  also ex post facto.)  But  nobody  ever  object s to receiving  a retroact ive raise at work. When we judge hist orical people and event s in t erms of present -day moralit y and at t it udes, our retroact ive judgment s may indicat e that we're t oo impressed with ourselves and ignorant of hist ory.
 
==========retrofit                      To furnish something with new or modified part s or equipment that was opt ional or unavailable at the t ime of manufact ure.


?
 The office building has been retrofit t ed with air-condit ioning, but the resulthas been a mixed success.


The concept of retrofit t ing became an urgent necessit y during World War  I, when weapons t echnology was advancing atan int ense pace and planes and ships were becoming out dat ed even before their construct ion was complet e, and the only solut ion was to retrofit  the complet ed craft with the brand-new t echnology. Retrofit t ing was revived on a massive scale during the energy crisis of the 1970s, when new feat ures were added to millions of old houses to make them more energy-efficient . Retrofit t ing is thus different from merely renovating, which may not involve any new t echnology atall.
 
==========retrogress
  To ret urn to an earlier and usually worse or more primit ive stat e.


?
 According to the t est s, the sophomores had act ually retrogressed in the course of spring t erm.


As you might guess, retrogress is the opposit e of progress. Retrogression is usually an undesirable decline from a higher or advanced level. So, for instance, in difficult social sit uat ions an adolescent can retrogress to a childish level of mat urit y. And under the extreme condit ions of t otal war, a whole societ y may retrogress to a primit ive stat e. The increasing number of poor or homeless people has been seen as evidence of modern social retrogression, and the rise of loud, name-calling TV and  radio  personalit ies  strikes  many  people  as  a  sign  of  polit ical retrogression.
 
==========retrospect ive
  A generally comprehensive  exhibit ion  or performance usually covering an art ist 's out put to dat e.


?
 A retrospect ive covering the phot ographer's ent ire career is forcing crit ics to revise their earlier est imat es of her stat us as an art ist .


Retrospective is part ly root ed in the Latin verb specere, "t o look," so a retrospect ive is a look back atan art ist 's career. The subject of a retrospect ive is usually an older living art ist , or one who has recent ly died. Galleries and museums honor paint ers and sculpt ors, film fest ivals honor direct ors and act ors, and concert organizat ions honor composers. Retrospect ives can be difficultand expensive to assemble, so they're rarely put t ogether except  for deserving art ist s; the result is that they frequent ly win many new fans for the person's achievement .

==========TEMPOR comes from the Latin tempus, meaning "t ime." A temporary repair is meant to last only a short t ime. The tempo, or speed, of a country-and-west ern ballad is usually different from that of a hip-hop number. The Latin phrase Tempus fugit means "Time flies,"  an observat ion that seems more true during summer vacat ion than in the dead of wint er.
 
==========t emporal                        (1) Having to do with t ime as opposed to et ernit y; having to do with earthly life as opposed to heavenly exist ence. (2) Having to do with t ime as dist inguished from space.


?
 The quick passing of the seasons as we grow older makes us feel the fleet ing nat ure of t emporal exist ence.


Temporal exist ence is oft en contrast ed with spirit ual exist ence, which many religions t each is et ernal. The American syst em of government feat ures a separat ion of church and stat e-that is, a separat ion of spirit ual and t emporal authorit y. But such separat ion is relat ively recent . In past cent uries, the Roman Catholic Church exert ed t emporal authorit y-that is, polit ical power
-throughout much of Europe, and the Church of England has always been officially headed by the t emporal ruler of Great Britain. Temporal isn'talways used in religious cont ext s; for example, child psychologist s oft en measure "t emporal processing"-that is, speed of thinking
-in children with mental difficult ies. Not e that temporal may also mean "near the t emples (of the head)"; thus, your brain's temporal lobes are sit uat ed at your t emples. But this temporal is based on a different Latin root .
 
==========cont emporary
          (1) Occurring or exist ing during the same period of t ime. (2) Having to do with the present period; modern or current .


?
 The two scient ist s were cont emporary with each other, but neither seemed to have heard of the other's exist ence.


Contemporary can be confusing because of it s slight ly different meanings. In everyday use, it generally means simply "modern" or "new." But before the 20th cent ury it inst ead referred only to things from the same era as certain other things; so, for instance, Jesus was cont emporary with the Roman emperors August us and Tiberius, and Muhammad was cont emporary with Pope Gregory the Great . And contemporary is also a noun: thus, Jane Aust en's contemporaries included Coleridge and Wordsworth, and your own cont emporaries were born around the same year that you were.
 
==========ext emporaneous
               (1) Composed, performed, spoken, or done on the spur of the moment ; imprompt u or improvised. (2) Carefully prepared but delivered without not es.


?
 It was once common in middle-class  homes to make  ext emporaneous  speeches, recit e poetry, and give lit t le solo song recitals aft er a dinner with guest s.


The abilit y to speak well extemporaneously is an important talent for polit icians, especially when part icipat ing in debat es. (Though it 's also a good idea to have a "spin doct or" who can go outaft erward and t ell everyone what the candidat e really meant to say.) Some people claim  there's   a   difference   bet ween extemporaneous   and impromptu,  saying   that   an ext emporaneous speech is planned beforehand but not writ t en down, while an imprompt u speech is genuinely unprepared or off-the-cuff, but t oday the two words are most ly used as synonyms.
 
==========t emporize                    (1) To act in a way that fit s the t ime or occasion; to give way to current opinion. (2) To draw out discussions to gain t ime.


?
 The legislat ure was accused of t emporizing while the budget deficit cont inued to worsen.


The Latin word that temporize comes from meant simply "t o pass the t ime"; the meaning of the  English  word  is  different   but   obviously  relat ed.  People  aren't   usually  admired  for t emporizing. A polit ical leader faced with a difficult issue may t emporize by talking vaguely about possible solut ions withoutact ually doing anything. The point is to avoid taking an act ion that lot s of people aren't going to like, in hopes that the problem will somehow go away, but  the effect is oft en just to make mat t ers worse.
 
==========CHRON comes from the Greek word for "t ime." A chronicle records the event s of a part icular t ime, which is why so many newspapers have the name Chronicle. A chronometer is a device for measuring t ime, usually one that 's more accurat e (and more expensive) than an ordinary wat ch or clock.
 
==========chronic                (1)  Last ing  a  long  t ime  or  recurring  frequent ly. (2) Always  present ; constant ly annoying or troubling; habit ual.


?
 He had st opped to pick up ice-cream cones for the kids, hoping it would give him a t emporary rest from their chronic bickering.


Chronic coughing goes on and on; chronic lat eness occurs day aft er day; chronic lameness never seems to getany bet t er. Unfort unat ely, sit uat ions that we call chronic almostalways seem to be unpleasant . We never hear about chronic peace, but we do hear about chronic warfare. And we never speak of chronic health, only of chronic illness.
 
==========chronology
 (1) A sequence of event s in the order they occurred. (2) A table, list , or account that present s event s in order.


?
 The scandal had got t en so complex that the newspaper had to printa chronology showing the order of the numerous event s involved.


Hist ory is much more than a simple chronology of event s, but keeping event s in chronological order is the first essent ial st ep in thinking about it . When, for example, hist orians try to show how World War I prepared the way for World War I, tracking the chronology of the event s in the years bet ween the two wars can help in explaining a complicat ed hist orical era.
 
==========anachronism
       (1) The error of placing a person or thing in the wrong t ime period. (2) A person or thing that is out of it s own t ime.


?
 A Model T Ford put t -put t ing down the highway at 25 miles per hour was an anachronism by 1940.


In Shakespeare's t ime, playwright s didn't worry much aboutanachronisms. When Shakespeare saw his plays performed, all the charact ers, even Romans and Greeks, would have been dressed in the clothes of his own period. Macbeth, which is set in the 11th cent ury, contains anachronistic references to clocks and cannons, which the real Macbeth would have known nothing about . Today, a writ er may spend months doing research in order to avoid anachronisms in the hist orical novel she's working on. Using the second meaning of the word, we could say that manual t ypewrit ers and slide rules are anachronisms in these days of comput ers and calculat ors, and a person who likes doing things the old-fashioned way mighthimself be described as an anachronism.
 
==========synchronous                          (1)  Happening  or  exist ing  at   exact ly  the  same  t ime; simultaneous. (2) Recurring or act ing at exact ly the same int ervals.


?
 The theory depends on whether the chemical appeared in synchronous deposit s worldwide seven million years ago.


Communicat ions sat ellit es are usually put int o a synchronous (or geosynchronous) orbit , circling the earth once every 24 hours and so appearing to hover over a single spot on the surface. This t ype of synchronized movement is important , since you have to know where to aim your sat ellit e dish. In the comput er field, synchronous usually refers to the use of a simple t iming signal that permit s very rapid exchange  of  data  bet ween  comput ers. The  kind  of myst erious coincidence somet imes called synchronicity-such as the appearance of two different comic-strip charact ers named Dennis the Menace in the U.S. and Britain within three days of each other in 1951-has fascinat ed people for cent uries.

TRI means "three," whether derived from Greek or Latin. A tricycle has three wheels. A triangle
has three sides and three angles. And a triumvirate is a board or government of three people.
 
==========triad         (1) A group of three usually relat ed people or things. (2) A secret Chinese criminal organizat ion.


?
 The kids in the garage band next door seemed to know six or seven triads and a couple of seventh chords.


The best -known t ype of triad is a t ype of musical chord consist ing of three not es. A D-major  triad is made up of the not es D, F-sharp, and A; an F-minor triad is made up of F, A-flat , and C; and so on. Major and minor triads form the basis of t onal music, and songs and other pieces usually end with a triadic harmony. In medicine, a triad is a set  of three sympt oms that  go t ogether. The Chinese criminal organizat ions called triads got their name from the triangular symbol that they used back when they began, cent uries ago, as patriot ic organizat ions. Today, with over 100,000 members, the triads operat e in the U.S., Canada, and many other countries.
 
==========trilogy             A series of three creat ive works that  are closely relat ed and develop a single theme.


?
 William Faulkner's famous "Snopes trilogy" consist s of the novels The Hamlet, The Town, and
The Mansion.


Dozens of tragic trilogies were writ t en for the Greek stage, though only one, Aeschylus's great Oresteia (consist ing of Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides), has survived complet e. Authors  in  lat er  years  have  occasionally  chosen to creat e  trilogies to allow themselves to develop a highly complex st ory or cover a long span of t ime. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings wasn'tact ually int ended as a trilogy, but since it was published in three volumes it 's usually called one. George Lucas's three original Star Wars movies are an example of a film trilogy (which he followed many years lat er by another).
 
==========tricerat ops
     One of a group of large dinosaurs that  lived during the Cretaceous period and had three horns, a bony crest or hood, and hoofed t oes.


?
 The tricerat ops probably used it s three horns for defense against the at tacks of meat -eat ing dinosaurs.


The name triceratops, meaning lit erally "three-horned face," refers to the two horns above it s eyes and the smaller third horn on it s snout . Justas striking was the frilled hood or ruff thatrose behind it s head, though no one is quit e sure what it was for. The tricerat ops was one of the last dinosaurs to evolve and also one of the last to become ext inct . It could reach lengths of 30 feetand could stand nearly eight feethigh. Despit e it s ferocious looks and three-foot - long horns, the tricerat ops was act ually a vegetarian.
 
==========trident           A three-pronged spear, especially one carried by various sea gods in classical mythology.


?
 The bronze stat ue at the middle of the great fountain depict ed a sea god emerging from the wat er, wreathed in seaweed and carrying a large trident .


A tridenthas three prongs or t eeth, as the root dent, "t ooth," t ells us. The tridenthas long been used to spear fish in different part s of the world, so there's no myst ery about why the Greek sea god Poseidon and his Roman count erpart Nept une both carry a tridentas their symbol. In some gladiat or exhibit ions in ancientrome, one gladiat or, called a retiarius ("net man"), would be equipped as though he were a fisherman, with a weight ed netand a trident ; with his nethe would snare his sword-wielding opponent , and with his tridenthe would spear his helpless foe.
 
==========trimest er                   (1) A period of about three months, especially one of three such periods in a human pregnancy. (2) One of three t erms  int o  which  an  academic  year  is somet imes divided.


?
 Most women experience morning sickness in the first trimest er of pregnancy.


Semester, which comes from the Latin words for "six" and "month," has come to mean half an academic year when the year is divided int o two segment s. When an academic year is divided int o three segment s, each is called a trimest er (which is usually a bit more accurat e, since each segment oft en is close to three months in length). Some colleges operat e on the "quart er" syst em, with the summer being the fourth quart er, but this just means that each quart er is basically a trimest er. In a human pregnancy, a trimest er is three months long, represent ing one- third of the nine months thata t ypical pregnancy last s.
 
==========trinit y                      (1) (capitalized) The unit y of Father, Son, and Holy Spiritas three persons in one God in Christ ian belief. (2) A group of three people.


?
 In Christ ian art depict ing the Trinit y, the Holy Spirit is almostalways shown as a radiant dove.


The nat ure of the Trinit y (or Holy Trinit y) has caused cent uries of argumentand division within the Christ ian faith. The word doesn'tact ually appear in the Bible it self, but the New Testament does speak of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit t ogether; the Father is underst ood as the prot ect or of the Jews, the Son as the savior of mankind, and the Holy Spiritas the preserver of the church. Almostall the major Christ ian sect s may be called trinitarian. The island of Trinidad is one of many places named with the Spanish translat ion of Trinity.
 
==========tript ych           (1) A pict ure or carving made in the form of three panels side by side. (2) Something composed or present ed in three sect ions.


?
 The Renaissance produced many beaut iful tript ychs portraying religious scenes thatare st ill used as altarpieces.


Triptych contains the root -ptyche, the Greek word for "fold." So a tradit ional paint ed or carved tript ych has three hinged panels, and the two out er panels fold in t oward the central one. Most tript ychs were int ended to be mount ed over a church altar. Many great tript ychs were produced in the Renaissance, perhaps the most famous being Hieronymus Bosch's Garden of Earthly Delights. But major tript ychs cont inued to be produced throughout the 20th cent ury by such paint ers as Francis Bacon.
 
==========trivial                      Of lit t le value or importance.


?
 She was so caught up in the trivial details of the trip that she hardly not iced the beaut iful scenery.


Trivial  comes  from a  Latin  word  meaning  "crossroads"-that  is, where  three  roads  come t ogether. Since a crossroads is a very public place where all kinds of people might show up, trivialis came to mean "commonplace" or "vulgar." Today the English word has changed slight ly in meaning and inst ead usually describes something barely worth ment ioning. Mathemat icians use the word to refer to some part of a proof or definit ion that 's extremely simple and needn't be explained, but the rest of us t end to use it just to mean "unimportant ." "Small talk" ata part y, for example, is usually trivial conversat ion, though a trivial excuse for not going on a dat e ("I have to wash my hair") mighthide an emot ion that isn't so trivial ("I can't stand the sight of you"). To trivialize something is to treat itas if it didn't mat t er, as if it were justanother triviality.

Quiz17-1 Quiz17-2 Quiz17-3 Quiz17-4 Quiz17-5 ReviewQuizzes17

ANIM comes from the Latin anima, meaning "breath" or "soul." So, for example, an animal is a living, breathing thing-though human animals have oft en argued about whether other species act ually have souls.
 
==========animat ed
    (1) Full of life; lively, vigorous, act ive. (2) Seeming or appearing to be alive.


?
 Her gest ures as she talked were so animat ed that even people across the room were wat ching her.


Animat ed cart oon charact ers have been "given life" by film t echniques, though the animation of drawings act ually goes back to handheld t oys in the 1830s. A child wat ching the cart oon may also be animat ed-squealing, laughing, and jumping around-as can a crowd of hockey fans or a rock-concertaudience. And the best discussions and argument s are oft en highly animat ed.
 
==========magnanimous
  (1)  Showing  a  loft y  and  courageous  spirit .  (2) Generous and forgiving.


?
 She was magnanimous in vict ory, saying she'd been lucky to win and praising her opponent 's effort .


The basic meaning of magnanimity is "great ness of spirit ." Thus, magnanimit y is the opposit e of pet t iness or "smallness." A truly magnanimous person can lose without complaining and win without gloat ing. Angry disput es can somet imes be resolved when one side makes a magnanimous gest ure t oward the other. And it 's the mark of magnanimit y to give credit to everyone who worked on a project even if you'd rather itall went to you.
 
==========animosit y
   Ill will or resent ment .


?
 Legend has it that  the animosit y bet ween the Greeks and the Trojans began with the st ealing of the beaut iful Helen from her husband, Menelaus.


The important  Latin word animus (very closely relat ed to anima) could mean a great  many things having to do with the soul and the emot ions, one of them being "anger." As an English word, animus has generally meant "ill will," so it isn't myst erious thatanimosity means basically the same thing. Animosit y can exist bet ween two people, two groups or organizat ions, or two countries, and can somet imes lie hidden for years before reappearing. The deep animosit ies that exist bet ween certain ethnic and religious groups somet imes seem as if they will last forever.
 
==========inanimat e
   (1) Notalive; lifeless. (2) Not lively; dull.


?
 The sculpt ures of Rodin are so expressive that , although inanimat e, they seem full of life and emot ion.


The couch you sit on while you wat ch TV is an inanimat e object , as is your footrest , your bag of snacks, and your remot e control. Spend t oo much t ime on that couch and you risk becoming a couch potat o. (A potat o is an inanimat e object .)
 
==========FIG comes from a Latin verb meaning "t o shape or mold" and a noun meaning "a form or shape." So a figure is usually a shape. A transfiguration transforms the shape or appearance of something. And a disfiguring injury changes the appearance of part of the body for the worse.
 
==========figurat ive
    (1) Represent ing form or figure in art . (2) Saying one thing in t erms normally meaning or describing another thing.


?
 When the poet says he's been living in the desert , it 's a figurat ive reference to his emot ional life.


Words and phrases can have both lit eral and figurat ive meanings, and we all use words with both kinds of meanings every day of our lives. We can lit erally close the door to a room, or we can figuratively close the door to further negot iat ions-that  is, refuse to take part  in them. Figurat ive language includes figures of speech, such as similes ("she's been like a sist er to me") and metaphors ("a st orm of prot est "). And somet imes it 's hard to t ell whether a phrase is lit eral or figurat ive: If I say I "picked up" a lit t le Spanish in Mexico, is that lit eral or figurat ive?
 You've probably not iced that lot s of the definit ions in this book show both a lit eral meaning (oft en something physical) and a figurat ive meaning (oft en nonphysical).
 
==========configurat ion
     An  arrangement  of  part s  or  element s; shape, design.


?
 We've changed the configurat ion of the office so that employees will have more privacy at their desks.


The  t erm  is  very  common  in  comput er  science  and  mathemat ics, and  in  scient ific  and t echnological fields in general. Thus, for example, two scient ist s won a 1962 Nobel Prize for their descript ion of  the  configurat ion  of  the  DNA molecule. Since  then, researchers  have st udied what different configurat ions within the DNA strands mean and what they control, and genet ic engineers have tried to configure or reconfigure DNA in new ways to prevent or treat diseases.
 
==========effigy                    An image of a person, especially a crude representat ion of a hat ed person.


?
 The night before the big game, an effigy of the rival coach was burned on a huge bonfire.


It was the pract ice of the ancient Egypt ians to bury an effigy of a dead person along with that person's body. The idea was that if anything happened to the body in the aft erlife, the effigy could be used as a spare. Effigy now usually refers to crude st uffed figures of the kind that getabused by angry prot est ors and unruly college st udent s. But the small dolls that wit ches have used to bring pain and death on their vict ims can be called effigies as well. Act ually, those wit ches and college kids seem to use their effigies for pret t y much the same thing.
 
==========figment                        Something made up or imagined.


?
 His preference for Cindy is a figment of your imaginat ion; believe me, he barely knows she exist s.


A figment is something formed from imaginary element s. Daydreams are figment s; night mares are figment s that can seem very real. Most figment s are everyday fears and hopes about small things that t urn out to be imaginary.

==========ANN/ENN comes from Latin annus, meaning "year." An annual event occurs yearly. An anniversary is an example of an annual event , although the older you get the more frequent they seem to be.
 
==========annuit y              Money that is payable yearly or on some regular basis, or a contract providing for such payment .


?
 Throughouther working career she invest ed regularly in annuit ies that would support  her aft er ret irement .


Annuit ies are handy things to have when you ret ire, since they provide an income on an annual basis or more frequent ly. Annuit ies are normally contract s with life-insurance companies that specify that payment s begin atret irement . Company pensions are tradit ionally doled out in the form of annuit ies, and sweepstakes jackpot s may also come as annuit ies. An annuit y can be a wise idea if you think you're going to live a long t ime; however, annuit ies can be tricky and should only be purchased aft er carefully comparing the product s offered by various companies.
 
==========superannuat ed
         (1) Out worn, old-fashioned, or out -of-dat e. (2) Forced to ret ire because of old age or infirmit y.


?
 He called himself a car collect or, buthis backyard looked like a cemet ery for superannuat ed clunkers.


A superannuat ed st yle is out -of-dat e-it s t ime has come and gone. And a person who has passed an age limitand been forced to ret ire may t echnically be called superannuat ed. But more oft en superannuated describes people who seem somehow to belong to the past . So a 55-year-old surfer might be regarded as superannuat ed by the young crowd riding the waves in Santa Cruz, and a superannuat ed hippie might st ill be dressing the way he did in 1972.
 
==========millennium                   (1) A period of t ime last ing 1,000 years, or the celebrat ion of a 1,000-year anniversary. (2) A period of greathappiness and perfect ion on earth.


?
 The first millennium B.C. saw the rise of important civilizat ions in Greece, Rome, India, Central America, and China.


Since in Latin mille means "thousand" (see MILL), a millennium last s 1,000 years. Thus, we're living t oday at the beginning of the third millennium since the birth of Christ . But some religious sect s, relying on a prophecy in the biblical Book of Revelat ion, speak of a coming millennium when Jesus will ret urn to reign on earth for 1,000 years, evil will be banished, and all will live in peace and happiness. Members of these sect s who keep themselves in a constant stat e of preparedness are called millenarians or millennialists.
 
==========perennial                           (1) Cont inuing to grow for several years. (2) Enduring or cont inuing without int errupt ion.


?
 "See You in Sept ember" is a perennial summert ime hitamong lovesick t eenagers.


A perennial garden is full of perennials like delphiniums and ast ers, flowers that cont inue to bloom year aft er year. (Annuals, by contrast , grow for only a single season and must be replant ed annually, and biennials die aft er two years.) Evergreens are perennially green; for thatreason, they're perennial favorit es for Christ mas wreaths and decorat ions. In a similar way, taxes are a perennial polit ical issue; and a perennial polit ical candidat e may come back over and over claiming he's the only one who can save us from them.
 
==========EV comes from the Latin aevum, "age" or "lifet ime." Though the root occurs in only a few English words, it 's relat ed to the Greek aion, "age," from which we get the word eon, meaning "a very long period of t ime."
 
==========coeval                       Having the same age or last ing the same amount of t ime; cont emporary.


?
 Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, probably writ t en around 700 B.C., are coeval with port ions of the Hebrew Bible, or Old Testament .


Coeval usually describes things that exist ed t ogether for a very long t ime or that originat ed at the same t ime in the distant past . Thus, astronomers might speak of one galaxy as being coeval with another, and a period in the hist ory of one civilizat ion might be coeval with a similar period in another. As a noun, however, coeval may describe people as well; so, for example, two art ist s who lived and worked at the same t ime might be described as coevals.
 
==========longevit y
   (1) A long durat ion of life. (2) Length of life; long cont inuance.


?
 Picasso had a career of remarkable longevit y, and was producing plent ifully unt il his death at 91.


As living condit ions improve and the science of medicine advances, the longevit y of  the average American has increased great ly, from about 45 years in 1900 to over 75 years t oday. But the most impressive human longevit y is nothing compared to the 400-year lifespan of an ocean clam found near Iceland, or the 5,000-year lifespan of the brist lecone pine, a tree found in the west ern U.S. We may use longevity to talk not only aboutact ual lives butalso of the useful "life" of things: the life of your car's t ires or the shingles on your roof, for example.
 
==========medieval
      (1) Relat ing to the Middle Ages of European hist ory, from about
A.D. 500 to 1500. (2) Extremely out -of-dat e.


?
 The great cathedral at Chartres in France, finished in 1220, is a mast erpiece of medieval archit ect ure.


With it s root s medi-, meaning "middle," and ev-, meaning "age," medieval lit erally means "of the Middle Ages." In this case, middle means "bet ween the Roman empire and the Renaissance"- that is, aft er the fall of the greatroman stat e and before the "rebirth" of cult ure that we call the Renaissance. This same period used to be called the "Dark Ages," since it was believed that in these years civilizat ion all but vanished. And indeed, for most Europeans in these cent uries, it was a t ime of povert y, famine, plague, and superst it ion, rather than the age of magic, dazzling swordplay, t owering cast les, and knight s in splendid armor displayed in t oday's graphic novels and video games.
 
==========primeval                       (1) Having to do with the earliest  ages; primit ive or ancient . (2) Exist ing from the beginning.


?
 When European set t lers firstarrived in North America, they found vast tract s of primeval forest , seemingly unt ouched by human influence.


With it s prim- prefix, meaning "first ," primeval obviously refers to an original age. So the word oft en suggest s the  earliest periods in the  earth's hist ory. Myths are oft en  st ories of the creat ion of the world and of it s primeval beings. The trees in a primeval forest (few of which remain t oday in most countries) may be 400 years old-notas old as the world, but maybe as old as they ever live t o. According to scient ist s, life on earth began in the prot ein-rich wat ers of the primeval seas and swamps, and the decay of their t iny organisms and plant mat t er over millions of years produced our petroleum and coal.

==========CORP comes from corpus, the Latin word for "body." A corpse is a dead body. A corporation is also a kind of body, since it may actalmost like an individual. And a corps is a "body" of soldiers.
 
==========corporeal
   Having or relat ing to a physical body; substant ial.


?
 In paint ings, angels usually look very much like corporeal beings, oft en with act ual feathered wings.


In various religions, including Christ ianit y, corporeal exist ence is oft en called the opposit e of spiritual exist ence, and corporeal exist ence, unlike spirit ual exist ence, is oft en said to be contaminat ed with evil. The word is also oft en used by philosophers, especially when considering the nat ure of realit y. For lawyers, corporeal describes physical propert y such as houses or cars, as opposed to something valuable but nonphysical like a good reputat ion.
 
==========corpulent
    Having a large, bulky body; obese.


?
 Squire Jenkins had oft en been described as "st out " or "port ly," but more recent ly the word his acquaintances were using was usually "corpulent ," or even "fat ."


The Duchess of Windsor may have said that you can never be t oo rich or t oo thin, but that 's a rather modern point of view. In earlier t imes in Europe, being overweight was considered a sign of wealth and well-being, as demonstrat ed by the corpulence of many European kings. St ill t oday, corpulence is thought to be superior to thinness in some of the world's cult ures. But corpulentand corpulence are less oft en used than they once were, and we're now probably more likely to say "obese" and "obesit y."
 
==========corporal                           Relat ing to or affect ing the body.


?
 She was reminded that , in the public-school syst em, shaking a child was now regarded as unacceptable corporal punishment .


The adject ive corporal t oday usually appears in the phrase corporal punishment, which means "bodily punishment ." This used to include such act s as mut ilat ion, branding, imprisonment , and even death. But t oday execut ion comes under the separat e heading of "capital punishment ," which originally involved losing your head (capit- meaning "head"). Milder forms of corporal punishmentare used by American parent s, and were once common in schools as well. Corporal is occasionally used in other ways; in the tradit ional church, the "corporal works of mercy" include seven helpful act s such as shelt ering the homeless and burying the dead. Corporal as a military rank act ually comes from caporal-which has the same rootas capital.
 
==========incorporat e
 (1) To blend or combine int o something already exist ing to form one whole. (2) To form or form int o a corporat ion.


?
 The new edit ion incorporat es many suggest ions and correct ions received by the author from his readers.


From it s root s, incorporate means basically "add int o a body" or "form int o a body." So, for example, a chef might decide to incorporat e a couple of new ingredient s int o an old recipe, and then might incorporat e that new it em int o the restaurant 's dinner menu. The restaurant it self was  probably incorporated at  the beginning, and so is now a corporation-that  is, a "body" that 's legally allowed to act like a single person in certain ways, even if it may have many individual employees. As you can see, the two meanings t urn out to be fairly different .
 
==========TANG/TACT comes from the Latin words tangere, "t o t ouch," and tactus, "sense of t ouch." So, for instance, to make contact is to t ouch or "get in t ouch with."
 
==========tact              The abilit y to deal with others without offending them.


?
 Already at 16 his daught er showed remarkable tact in dealing with adult s, which she certainly hadn't got t en from him.


This word came to English direct ly from French (a Latin-based language), where it can also mean simply "sense of t ouch." Dealing with difficult sit uat ions involving  other people  can require the kind of extreme sensit ivit y that our fingert ips possess. As Lincoln once said, "Tact is the abilit y to describe others as they see themselves," which doesn't usually come nat urally. Someone tactful can soothe the feelings of the most difficult people; a tactless person will generally make a bad sit uat ion worse.
 
==========tact ile                   (1) Able to be perceived by t ouching. (2) Relat ing to the sense of t ouch.


?
 He always enjoyed the tact ile sensat ion of running his hand over the lush t urf.


If you set your cell phone to vibrat e rather than ring, you're taking the tact ile opt ion. Educat ors believe that some st udent s are nat urally "tact ile learners," much bet t er at "hands-on" learning than at tasks that involve pat ient list ening and reading. Many longt ime readers resist using e- books, saying they miss the tact ile sensat ions of leafing through an act ual book. And the blind, using the raised dot s of the braille alphabet , rely ent irely on their tact ile sense to read; some can act ually read as fastas the average person can read out loud.
 
==========tangent ial
   Touching light ly; incidental.


?
 The government is trying to det ermine if the extremist s were deeply involved or if their relat ionship to the suspect was merely tangent ial.


In geometry, a tangent is a straight line that t ouches a curve ata single point . So we say that someone who start s talking about one thing and get s sidetracked has gone off on a tangent . The new subject is tangent ial to the first subject -it t ouches itand moves off in a different direct ion.
 
==========tangible                          Able to be perceived, especially by t ouch; physical, substant ial.


?
 The snow was tangible evidence that wint er had really come.


Something that 's lit erally tangible can be t ouched. A rock is tangible, and so is a broken window; if the rock is lying next to the window, it could be tangible evidence of vandalism. When we say that the t ension in a room is tangible, we mean we feel it so strongly that it seems almost physical. But if we're being lit eral, t ension, like hope, happiness, and hunger, is lit erally intangible-it may  be  real, but  it  can't  be  t ouched. When  lawyers  talk  about  an intangible asset , they might mean something like a company's good reputat ion-very valuable, but not quit e t ouchable.

==========CODI/CODE comes from the Latin codex, meaning "trunk of a tree" or "document writ t en on wooden tablet s." A code can be either a set of laws or a syst em of symbols used to writ e messages. To encode a message is to writ e it in code. A genet ic code, transmit t ed by genes, is a set of instruct ions for everything from blood t ype to eye color.
 
==========codex               A book in handwrit t en form, especially a book of Script ure, classics, or ancient t ext s.


?
 There on the shelves of the monast ery library they saw codex aft er codex, all carefully copied and illustrat ed by hand.


In the 3rd and 4th cent uries A.D., the codex began to replace the older scroll as the preferred form for longer writ ings. Unlike the scroll, this wonderful invent ion permit t ed writ ing on both sides of a sheet , made it easy to locat e a part icular passage, and could contain a very long piece of writ ing. Codices (not e this unusual plural form) were usually writ t en on parchment , the specially prepared skin of a sheep or goat , or papyrus, the ancest or of paper. Because codices were handwrit t en, there were few copies of any single codex, and somet imes only a single copy. Today we no longer writ e our books in longhand, but the modern book has kept basically  the same form as the original codices.
 
==========codicil           (1) An amendment  or addit ion  made to a  will. (2) An  appendix or supplement .


?
 With the birth of each new grandchild, the old man added a new codicil to his will.


A codicil is lit erally a "lit t le codex," a lit t le bit of writ ing on a small piece of writ ing mat erial, used to add to or change something abouta larger piece of writ ing. A codicil to a will can change the t erms of the original will complet ely, so it generally requires wit nesses just like the will it self, though in some stat es a handwrit t en codicil may not . In myst ery novels, such changes have been known to cause murders; in real life, codicils aren't usually quit e that excit ing.
 
==========codify                       To arrange according to a syst em; classify.


?
 In the  6th  cent ury B.C., the  great stat esman Solon newly codified the laws of Athens, replacing the harsh legal code of Draco.


A code is a collect ion of laws arranged in an orderly way; famous examples include the Code of Hammurabi, from about 1760 B.C. in ancient Babylon, and the Napoleonic Code, produced at Napoleon's orders in 1804. Laws thathave been included in a code have been codified. The rules of baseball differed great ly from one place to another unt il they were codified by Alexander Cart wright in 1845; they haven't changed much since, though we don't know what Cart wright would say about the designat ed hit t er.
 
==========
decode  (1) To puta coded message int o an understandable form. (2) To find the underlying meaning of; decipher.


?
 The Allies were able to decode many important secret messages sent by the Germans and Japanese in World War I.


T o decode is to take out of code and put int o understandable language. (It s opposit e is encode, "t o put int o coded form.") But dreams may somet imes also be decoded; psychologist s oft en try to decode the images of their pat ient s' dreams so as to understand the emot ions behind them. And readers must oft en decode whata novel or st ory or poem is t elling them, which may require two or three readings. Decipher is oft en a synonym, though we now use it when talking aboutreading difficulthandwrit ing.
 
==========SIGN comes from the Latin noun signum, "mark or sign." A signal is a kind of  sign. Your signature is your own personal sign. And an archit ect 's design marks out the pat t ern for a building.

?
 The improved performance of the st udent s signifies that the new approach may be working.


Signify basically means "t o make a sign or signal." One of it s synonyms is indicate; the index finger is the finger you point with, so to indicat e is essent ially to point to something. Significant means "important " and significance means "importance"; similarly, insignificant means "unimportant " and insignificance means "lack of importance."
 
==========insignia A badge of authorit y or honor; a dist inguishing sign or mark.


?
 Peering closely at the phot ograph, he could now see clearly the insignia of the Nazi SS on his grandfather's chest .


Insignia are the official signs of rank, t it les, or awards. Medals are an example, as are the crowns of monarchs. The Catholic church employs such insignia as the red robes of cardinals.
U.S. president s have the president ial seal, which appears on the stand when they're giving a speech. But most of us think first of the bars, stripes, badges, and pat ches of military rank.

 More than a dozen countries were signat ories to the agreement set t ing limit s on fishing in int ernat ional wat ers.


A signat ory put s his or her signature on a document that is also signed by others. In 1215 the English barons revolt ed against King John and forced him to join them as a signat ory to the Magna Carta. This agreement stat ed the barons' own dut ies to the King butalso assigned the barons clear right s and limit ed the King's power over them. Though the Magna Carta did nothing for the common people, it 's oft en been called the first st ep t oward democracy in the English-speaking countries.

?
 The chart ers of lands and right s of the early American colonies were confirmed with the king's signet .


Signet s have been used for thousands of years. The design of a signet is personalized for it s owner, and no two are alike. The ancient s used signet s to mark their possessions and to sign contract s. In lat er years signet s were used to stamp a blob of hot wax sealing a folded secret document so that it couldn't be opened and read without the design being broken.

 Washingt on, D.C., like a number of other cit ies, is divided int o quadrant s called Northwest , Northeast , Southwest , and Southeast .


This  word  is  used  for a  tradit ional instrument , used to make  calculat ions  of  alt it ude  and tradit ionally employed by sailors to navigat e, which has a piece shaped like a quart er of a circle. A quadrant shower is a shower that fit s snugly int o a bathroom corner and displays a curved front , making a quadrant shape on the floor.

==========quadrille                      A square dance popular in the 18th and 19th cent ury, made up of five or six pat t erns for four couples.


?
 Quadrilles were very popular at balls in the American South before the Civil War.


The quadrille, named for it s four couples that form the sides of a square, seems to have begun as a French country dance. In the 18th cent ury it became fashionable among the French nobilit y; as performed by elegant ly dressed arist ocrat s, it became slow and formal. It crossed over to England and from there to New England, where it t urned back int o a dance for the common people. It soon evolved int o the American square dance, a lively t ype of dance that employs a "caller" to make sure everyone remembers the st eps.
 
==========quadriplegic

?
 A mot orcycle accident in her t eens had killed her boyfriend and lefther a quadriplegic.


Quadriplegia is the result of injury or illness, almostalways affect ing the spine. Though a paraplegic has lost the use only of his or her legs, quadriplegics are paralyzed in all four limbs. Today voice-act ivat ed wheelchairs help the quadriplegic getaround, and houses can be equipped with similar syst ems to operat e light s and appliances; monkeys have even been trained to assist quadriplegics with everyday tasks. The work  of  the  quadriplegic  act or Christ opher Reeve has led to remarkable advances in developing new nerve connect ions, enabling some det ermined paraplegics and quadriplegics to walk again.

?
 He was senthome with a prescript ion for t etracycline and some advice abouthow to avoid Lyme disease in the fut ure.


Most  chemical names are made up of two or more Greek and Latin root s strung t ogether. Thus, tetracycline, with it s cycl- root  from the Greek word for "circle," means "four-ringed"- that is, "consist ing of four fused hydrocarbon rings." Ant ibiot ics work against  bact eria and other t iny organisms (but not viruses); t etracycline, which comes from a kind of soil bact eria, is one of the most used of the ant ibiot ics. "Broad-spectrum" ant ibiot ics work well on numerous organisms; thus, t etracycline has proved effect ive againstacne, chlamydia, cholera, ricket s, and various lung and eye infect ions, among many other condit ions.
 
==========t etrahedron
  A solid shape formed by four flat faces.


?
 Her son's box kit es was a t etrahedron, and it s pyramid shape was easy to pick outamong the tradit ional designs flown by the other children.


The simplest t etrahedron is made of four equal-sided triangles: one is used as the base, and the other three are fit t ed to itand each other to make a pyramid. But the great pyramids of Egyptaren't t etrahedrons: they inst ead have a square base and four triangular faces, and thus are five-sided rather than four-sided.
 
==========t etralogy
A set of four connect ed lit erary, art ist ic, or musical works.


?
 The Raj Quartet, Paul Scot t 's long and complex t etralogy of India, was made int o a highly praised t elevision series.


Vivaldi's Four Seasons could be called a t etralogy, since it 's a set of four violin concert os, one for each season of the year. Eight of Shakespeare's hist ory plays are oft en grouped int o two t etralogies. Wagner's greatring of  the  Nibelung,  an  opera  t etralogy  based  on  Norse mythology, contains about 18 hours of music. The original t etralogies, however, were set s of four plays by the same author performed t ogether in ancient Greece; the first three were always tragedies, and the last was a wild comedy. Tetralogies were writ t en by such great dramat ist s as Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripedes; unfort unat ely, none of them have survived in their ent iret y.
 
==========t etrapod
A vert ebrat e with two pairs of limbs.


?
 His special st udy was the great seismosaurus, probably the largest t etrapod-and the largest land animal-that ever lived.


The earliest t etrapods, or "four-foot ed" animals, were mammal-like rept iles that evolved before the rise of the dinosaurs and ranged from mouse-sized to cow-sized. Today the t etrapods include the rept iles, the amphibians, the birds, and the mammals-including humans. Though the fish aren't classified as t etrapods, it 's quit e possible that our own limbs began as paired fins hundreds of millions of years ago.

CAPIT, from the Latin word for "head," caput, t urns up in some important places. The head of a ship is it s captain, and the capital of a stat e or country is where the "head of stat e" works. A capital let t er stands head and shoulders above a lowercase let t er, as well as at the head (beginning) of a sent ence.
 
==========capitalism                          An economic syst em based on privat e ownership, privat e decisions, and open compet it ion in a free market .


?
 In the 1980s, the leaders of the free world had faith that capitalism and a free-market economy would solve all our problems.


Capital is wealth-that is, money and goods-that 's used to produce more wealth. Capitalism is pract iced enthusiast ically by capitalists, people who use capital to increase product ion and make more goods and money. Capitalism works by encouraging compet it ion in a fair and open market . It s opposit e is oft en said to be socialism. Where a capitalist economy encourages privat e act ions and ownership, socialism prefers public or government ownership and control of part s of the economy. In a pure capitalist syst em, there would be no public schools or public parks, no government programs such as Social Securit y and Medicare, and maybe not even any public highways or police. In a pure socialist syst em, there wouldn't be any  privat e corporat ions. In other words, there's justabout no such thing as pure capitalism or pure socialism in the modern world.
 
==========capit ulat e
      To surrender or st op resist ing; give up.


?
 At 2:00 a.m. the last three senat ors finally capit ulat ed, allowing the bill to move forward.


Capitulation oft en refers to surrender on the bat t lefield. Originally it only referred to surrender according to an agreement , though that part of the meaning is oft en absent . Today a t eacher can capit ulat e to her st udent s' cries of prot estagainsta homework assignment , or a father can capit ulat e to his kids' pleas to st op for ice cream, when the only t erms of the agreementare that they'll st op complaining.
 
==========decapitat e                      (1) To  cut  off  the  head; behead. (2) To  destroy  or make useless.


?
 The leaders of the uprising were decapitat ed, and their heads were mount ed on long poles on London Bridge as a warning to the people.


Decapitation is a quick and fairly painless way to go, so it was once considered suitable only for nobles like Sir Walt er Raleigh, Mary Queen of Scot s, and two of Henry V I's unfort unat e wives. The invent ion of the guillot ine in the 18th cent ury was meant to make execut ion swift er and more painless than hanging or a badly aimed blow by the execut ioner's sword.
 
==========recapit ulat e
      To repeat or summarize the most important point s or stages.


?
 At the end of his talk, the president carefully recapit ulat ed the main point s in order.


Capitulation originally meant the organizing of mat erial under headings. So recapitulation usually involves the gathering of the main ideas in a brief summary. Buta recapit ulat ion may be a complet e restat ementas well. In many pieces of classical music, the recapit ulat ion, or recap, is the long final sect ion of a movement , where the earlier music is restat ed in the main key.
 
==========ANTHROP comes from the Greek word for "human being." So an anthropomorphic god, such as Zeus or Athena, basically looks and act s like a human. And in Aesop's fables and many animat ed cart oons, animals are usually anthropomorphized and behave exact ly like furry, four- legged human beings.
 
==========anthropoid
      Any of several large, tailless apes.


?
 The  chimpanzees,  gorillas,  orangutans,  gibbons,  and  bonobos   are  all  classified   as anthropoids.


With it s suffix -oid, meaning "resembling," the word anthropoid means lit erally "resembling a human being." Anthropoid apes are so called because they resemble humans more closely than do other primat es such as monkeys and lemurs. Some even spend a good deal of t ime walking on their hind legs. Anthropoids are, of course, highly int elligent (though maybe no more so than many monkeys), and some of them use st icks and st ones as t ools. (But if you call someone an anthropoid, you're probably not compliment ing his int elligence.)
 
==========anthropology
      The science and st udy of human beings.


?
 By st udying the cult ures of primit ive peoples, anthropology may give us  a  bet t er understanding of our own cult ure.


Anthropologists, those who st udy the whys and wherefores of human exist ence, t oday look not only at the tribes of the Amazon butalso at the neighborhoods of Brooklyn or Santa Monica. Every group and every cult ure now seems to be possible mat erial for anthropology. Some anthropologist s specialize in the st udy of human evolut ion, some st udy human language, some st udy archaeology, and some st udy human cult ure through the ages. Unlike hist orians, they t end to focus less on whathas been recorded in writ ings than on what can be discovered in other ways.
 
==========misanthropic
     Hat ing or distrust ing humans.


?
 Few charact ers in lit erat ure are more misanthropic than Ebenezer Scrooge, who cares for nothing but money.


Jonathan Swift was famous for the misanthropy of works such as Gulliver's Travels  which make fun of all kinds of human foolishness. But in spit e of his apparent misanthropic at t it ude, he spenta third of his income on founding a hospital and another third on other charit ies- certainly not the act s of a true misanthrope. Today we oft en use synonyms such as cynic and grinch for misanthropic t ypes-while hoping we don't meet t oo many of them.
 
==========lycanthropy                     (1)  A   delusion   that   one   has   become   a   wolf.  (2) Transformat ion int o a wolf through wit chcraft or magic.


?
 The local farmers avoided the resident s of the village in the next valley, who had long been suspect ed of grave robbing and lycanthropy.


The Greek word for "wolf," lykos, combines with the anthro- root to produce the meaning "wolfman." In European folklore, dat ing back to the ancient Greeks and Romans, there are men who change int o wolves at nightand devour animals, people, or graveyard corpses before ret urning to human form at dawn. Werewolves, or lycanthropes, may be evil and possessed by the devil, or may inst ead be the vict ims of a werewolf bit e and thereby cursed to change int o wolf form at the full moon. The werewolf's evil int ent ion is shown by it s eat ing only part of the animal or corpse, rather than all of it like a truly hungry wolf.

==========KINE comes from the Greek word kinesis, meaning "movement ." Kinet ic energy is the energy of mot ion (as opposed to pot ent ial energy, the kind of energy held by a stret ched elast ic band). Kinet ic art is art thathas moving part s, such as Alexander Calder's famous mobiles. And cinema, the art of moving pict ures, act ually comes from the same kine- rootas well.
 
==========kinesiology
       The scient ific st udy of human movement .


?
 With a kinesiology degree in hand, she landed a job as a rehab therapist for pat ient s following heart surgery.


Kinesiologists st udy the acquisit ion of mot or skills, the mechanical aspect s of movement , and the body's responses to physical act ivit y. A kinesiologist may work in a public-school fit ness program, design exercise programs for  people  with  and  without  disabilit ies, or  work  with pat ient s recovering from disease, accident s, and surgery. As a field of research, kinesiology focuses part icularly on the mechanics of muscular act ivit y.
 
==========hyperkinet ic
    (1)  Relat ing to or  affect ed  with  hyperact ivit y.  (2) Charact erized by fast -paced or frant ic act ivit y.


?
 Noises Off is a hyperkinet ic stage farce that moves ata breathless pace for a full hour and a half.


Since the prefix hyper- means "above, beyond" (see HYPER) , hyperkinetic describes mot ion beyond the usual. The word is usually applied to children, and oft en describes the condit ion of almost uncontrollable act ivit y or muscular movement s called attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Kids with ADHD are usually not justhyperkinet ic  but  also  inat t ent ive, forget ful, and flight y. Though they're oft en treat ed with drugs, many expert s believe there are bet t er ways of dealing with the problem. Lot s of people now short en both hyperactive and hyperkinetic to simply hyper ("He's been hyper all morning"), but usually don't mean it t oo seriously.
 
==========kinescope
  A mot ion pict ure made from an image on a pict ure t ube.


?
 In the archives she t urned up several kinescopes of Ernie Kovacs's 1950s show, which she thoughthad been dumped int o New York Harbor decades ago.


Kinescope, originally a trademark for the cathode-ray t ube in a TV, lat er became the name for a film of a TV screen showing a live broadcast . In order for a program to be seen beyond New York in the early days of TV, a kinescope had to be shipped from stat ion to stat ion. Though grainy and fuzzy, these were for a t ime the only way of capt uring live shows. But in 1951 Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball decided to film their comedy show rather than to broadcast it live, and in a few years live broadcast comedy and drama had vanished from the airwaves.
 
==========t elekinesis
 The movement of object s without contact or other physical means, as by the exercise of an occult power.


?
 Fascinat ed by t elekinesis as a boy, he'd spenthours in his room trying to push a pencil off the table using only his mind.


Tele- in Greek means "far off" (see TELE). The et ernally appealing idea of moving an objectremot ely, using only psychic powers, has had a long life in films, TV shows, st ories and novels, video  games,  and  comics.  But  although  some  researchers  believe  in  the  exist ence  of t elekinesis (also known as psychokinesis), most scient ist s believe thatany report ed experiences have been the result of fraud, wishful thinking, or nat urally explainable event s.
 
==========DYNAM comes from the Greek dynamis, meaning "power." A dyne is a unit used in measuring force; an instrument that measures force is called a dynamometer. And when Alfred Nobel invent ed a powerful explosive in 1867, he named it dynamite.
 
==========dynamic                   (1)  Relat ing to physical  force  or  energy.  (2)  Cont inuously  and product ively act ive and changing; energet ic or forceful.


?
 The sit uat ion has ent ered a dynamic phase, and what we knew about it last week has changed considerably by now.


Dynamic is the opposit e of static, which means "not moving or act ive." So all living languages, for example, are dynamic rather than stat ic, changing from year to year even when they don'tappear to be. A bust ling  commercial cit y like  Hong  Kong  is int ensely dynamic, constant ly changing and adapt ing. A dynamic relat ionship-for example, the relat ionship bet ween housing values and int erestrat es charged by banks-is one  that  changes  all  the  t ime. Unfort unat ely, the word has been used so much by advert isers that we t end to forget it s basic meaning.
 
==========dynamo                   (1) A power generat or, especially one that  produces direct  electric current . (2) A forceful, energet ic person.


?
 Even as they ent ered the power plant , the roar of the wat er covered the sound of the immense dynamos.


The dynamo was introduced in 1832 to produce electricit y for commercial use. Like all lat er generat ors, the original dynamos changed mechanical energy (produced by st eam, which was it self produced by burning coal) int o electricit y. The word is less used t oday thanit once was, since it 's oft en applied only to generat ors that produced direct electric current (DC) rather than alt ernat ing current (AC), which is now the standard. A human dynamo is a person who seems to have unlimit ed energy, such as New York's legendary mayor Fiorello La Guardia, whose forcefulness and vigor mat ched that of his int ensely dynamic cit y.
 
==========aerodynamics
 (1) A science that  st udies the movement  of gases such as air and the way that object s move through such gases. (2) The qualit ies of an object thataffecthow easily it is able to move through the air.


?
 Early aut omobile designs were based on the boxlike carriages drawn by horses, back when no one was even thinking aboutaerodynamics.


Aerodynamics began as a science around the t ime of the Wright brothers' first manned flight s. Since then, it 's become important to the building not only of aircraftand aut omobiles butalso of rocket s and missiles, trains, ships, and even such struct ures as bridges and tall buildings, which oft en have to withstand strong winds. An aerodynamic vehicle is one whose design helps itachieve the great est speed and most efficient use of fuel. Butalthough we might casually call any sleek car design aerodynamic, true aerodynamics is pract iced not by art ist ic product designers but inst ead by highly trained scient ist s, and many people's lives depend on their work.
 
==========hydrodynamic
   Having to do with the science that st udies fluids in mot ion and the forces thatact on bodies surrounded by fluids.


?
 Building levees to contain a flood present s complicat ed hydrodynamic problems.


Bernoulli's principle, which is basic to the science of hydrodynamics, says that the fast er a fluid substance flows, the less out ward pressure it exert s. It shows the close relat ionship bet ween hydrodynamics and aerodynamics (which deals with the movement of air and other gases), since it can part ly explain how air will "lift " an airplane by the way it flows over the wings, and how a spoiler helps keep a race car's wheels pressed to the ground as itaccelerat es. Hydrodynamics is somet imes applied t oday in st udying the surface of the planet s and even the stars. As used informally by boat ers, hydrodynamic oft en means "hydrodynamically efficient ."

==========GRAD comes from the Latin noun gradus, "st ep" or "degree," and the verb gradi, "t o st ep, walk." A grade is a st ep up or down on a scale of some kind, and a gradual change takes place in small st eps.
 
==========gradat ion                       (1) A series made up of successive stages. (2) A st ep in an ordered scale.


?
 In the fall, the leaves show gradat ions of color from deepestred to bright est yellow.


In the Boy Scout s, gradat ions of rank move upward from Tenderfoot to Eagle Scout . A violin or a voice can produce gradat ions of musical pit ch t oo small to appear in writ t en music. In the 18th cent ury Jonathan Swift could even writ e of "the several kinds and gradat ions of laught er, which ladies must daily pract ice by the looking-glass."
 
==========degrade               (1) To treat someone or something poorly and withoutrespect . (2) To make the qualit y of something worse.


?
 They had feared for years that t elevision was degrading the mental capacit ies of their children.


In Shakespeare's King Lear, the old king is degraded by the daught ers he has given his kingdom t o. He finds it degrading, for instance, when the number of his guards is reduced from 100 to 25. His degradation seems complet e when, aft er going mad, he's reduced to living in the wilderness. As you can see, degrade is oft en a synonym for humiliate.
 
==========gradient                       (1) Slope, grade. (2) A cont inuous change in measure, act ivit y, or substance.


?
 St eep t emperat ure gradient s in the at mosphere are usually associat ed  with  unstable condit ions.


Any slope can be called a gradient . In the int erstat e highway syst em, the maximum gradient is 6 percent ; in other words, the highway may never ascend more than 6 vert ical feet over a distance of 100 feet . Any rat e of change that 's shown on a graph may have a sloped gradient . Suppose the graph's horizontal axis shows the passage of t ime and it s vert ical axis shows some act ivit y; if the act ivit y is happening very fast , then the gradient of the line on the graph will be st eep, but if it 's slow the gradient will be gent le, or gradual.
 
==========retrograde                      (1) Moving  or performed  in  a  direct ion  that  is  backward  or opposit e to the usual direct ion. (2) Moving t oward a worse or earlier stat e.


?
 For the government to cover up the findings of it s scient ific research inst it ut es was clearly a retrograde st ep.


Retrograde describes backwardness of one kind or another. If a country decided to go back to amputat ing the limbs of criminals, we might call that policy retrograde. A retrograde view of women might be  one  that  sees them basically  as housekeepers. Mars and  Jupit er show retrograde (backward) mot ion at some stages of their orbit s, though this is only because of the way we see them from the earth, not because of any real backward movement .
 
==========REG, from the Latin regula, meaning "rule," has given us many English words. Something regular follows a rule of some kind, even if it 's justa law of nat ure. A regime can be a form of rule or government . To regulate an industry means to make and enforce rules, or regulations, for it ; removing such rules is called deregulation.
 
==========regimen               A regular course of treat ment , usually involving food, exercise, or medicine.


?
 As part of his training regimen, he was now swimming two miles, running seven miles, and bicycling 15 miles every day.


Americans love self-improvement , so they're constant ly adopt ing regimens: skin-care regimens, low-cholest erol regimens, weight -loss regimens, and the like. A course of medicat ion may be complicat ed enough to deserve the name regimen, and a rehab regimen may require having your act ivit ies monit ored ata treat ment cent er. Mental regimens can also be valuable; researchers are finding that minds that get the most exercise seem to last the longest .
 
==========int erregnum                     (1) The t ime during which a throne is vacant bet ween two successive reigns or regimes. (2) A period during which the normal funct ions of government or control are suspended.


?
 During the weeklong int erregnum bet ween the CEO's death and the appoint ment of a new CEO, she felt that she was really running the whole show.


Every t ime a pope dies, there's an int erregnum period before a new one is elect ed by the cardinals. In most democrat ic syst ems, however, the law specifies who should take office when a president or prime  minist er  dies  unexpect edly,  and  since  the  power  usually  passes aut omat ically, there's no true int erregnum. The quest ion of succession-that is, of who should take over when a country's leader dies-has oft en present ed huge problems for countries that lacked a const it ut ion, and in monarchies ithasn'talways been clear who should become king or queen when a monarch dies. The int erregnum following the death of Edward VI in 1553, for instance, was briefly suspended when Lady Jane Grey was installed as Queen; nine days lat er she was replaced by Mary Tudor, who senther straight to the Tower of London.
 
==========regalia                        (1) The emblems and symbols of royalt y. (2) Special or official dress.


?
 The governor seems to enjoy life in the governor's mansion and all the regalia of office more than act ually doing his job.


Justas regal describes a king or queen-that is, a ruler-regalia originally meant the things, and especially the dress and decorat ion, that belong exclusively to a monarch. The Brit ish monarchy's regalia include the crown jewels (crown, scept er, orb, sword, et c.) that lend lust er to royal coronat ions. Academic regalia-the caps, gowns, and hoods worn by st udent s receiving their degrees-link inst it ut ions to their past by preserving the dress worn at universit ies since their beginnings in the Middle Ages, when long hooded robes were needed for warmth.
 
==========regency                     A government or period of t ime in which a regentrules in place of a king or queen.


?
 Since the fut ure king was only four when Louis XIV died, France spent eight years under a regency before he t ook the throne at 13 as Louis XV.


In Britain, the years from the t ime when George I was declared insane unt il his death (1811- 1820) are known as the Regency period, since in these years his son, the fut ure George IV, served as Prince Regent , or act ing monarch. (Somet imes the t erm covers the period up to the end of George IV's own reign in 1830.) The Regency is remembered for it s elegantarchit ect ure and fashions, it s lit erat ure (especially the works of Jane Aust en), and it s polit ics. Today hot els, furnit ure, and businesses on both sides of the At lant ic carry the name "Regency" to ident ify with the period's st yle, and hundreds of modern romance novels-called simply "Regencies"- have been set in the period. Though there have been dozens of European regencies over the cent uries, for Americans t oday there seems to be only one Regency.

==========CRIT comes from a Greek verb that means "t o judge" or "t o decide." So a film critic judges a movie and t ells us what 's good or bad about it . Her critical opinion may convince us not to go, or we may overlook any negat ive criticism and see itanyway.
 
==========crit erion
A standard by which a judgment or decision is made.


?
 He's one of those readers whose main crit erion for liking a book is whether it confirms his prejudices.


One person's principal crit erion for a new car may be it s gas mileage, while someone else's may be whether ithas room for four children. When filling a job opening, employers usually look for several crit eria (not ice the plural form) in the applicant s; and when college admissions officers are reading st udentapplicat ions, they likewise always keep a few basic crit eria in mind. And when int erviewing an applicant , one crit erion for both the employer and the admissions officer might include the size of the applicant 's vocabulary!
 
==========crit ique               A judgment or evaluat ion, especially a rat ing or discussion of merit s and fault s.


?
 Whenever he reads his lat est st ory in the fict ion-writ ing seminar, one of the other st udent s always delivers a nast y crit ique.


Even though criticize means to judge something negat ively, a  crit ique  can  be  complet ely posit ive-or complet ely negat ive. Usually it 's somewhere in bet ween. When a paper of yours receives a crit ique from a t eacher, you should read it carefully, and then reread it ; get t ing mad or offended is the worst way to react . Critique is oft en a verb as well. Thus, writ ers and art ist s oft en form groups solely to crit ique each other's work, and scient ific art icles frequent ly get crit iqued in let t ers to the edit or in the following issue of the journal.
 
==========hypercrit ical
    Overly crit ical.


?
 Most t eachers do their best to correct their st udent s' mistakes without seeming hypercrit ical.


The important prefix hyper- means "excessive" or "beyond" (see HYPER), so hypercritical means basically "t oo fussy." In TV and film comedies, the mother-in-law is justaboutalways hypercrit ical, since the person her child married is never good enough for her. But  other parent s, spouses, and even children can be justas bad, so we should all be careful. If your father asks what you think of his new experimental meat loaf and you say it needs a pinch of oregano, you're being construct ive; if you say he should cut down on the sawdust next t ime, you're probably being hypercrit ical.
 
==========hemat ocrit
      The rat io of the volume of red blood cells to whole blood.


?
 The lat est blood t esthad revealed thather hemat ocrithad risen considerably and was almost back to normal.


Our blood is most ly made up of four component s: plasma, red blood cells, whit e blood cells, and colorless blood cells called plat elet s. An instrument called a hemat ocrit (because it "judges" the blood) is used to separat e a sample of blood int o it s component s. The normal hemat ocrit for men is about 48%, for women about 38%. An abnormal proport ion of red blood cells, either t oo many or t oo few, is a good early indicat or of many diseases. So when you give blood as part of a physical exam, your hemat ocrit is one of the findings your doct or will oft en check.
 
==========JUR comes from the Latin verb jurare, "t o swear, take an oath," and the noun jus, "right or law." A jury, made  up  of jurors, makes judgment s based on the law. And a personal injury was originally something done to you thata court would find unjust .
 
==========jurisprudence
(1) A syst em of law. (2) The st udy and philosophy of law.


?
 As a young lawyer his heroes were the crusaders of 20th-cent ury jurisprudence, especially Louis Brandeis and Thurgood Marshall.


Jurisprudence as a st udy may have begun in the Roman empire, where schools of law were first established. And Roman jurisprudence, like so many other things the Romans creat ed, served as the model in lat er cent uries throughout the West ern world. And like many other legal words, jurisprudence is used only in formal writ ing.
 
==========abjure                  To reject formally.


?
 The Spanish Inquisit ion forced many Jews to abjure their religion and adopt Christ ianit y or be burned at the stake.


From it s Latin root s, abjure would mean lit erally "t o swear away." Thus, aft er the holidays many people abjure all sweet s and fat t ening foods, oft en making their vow in front of friends or relat ives. Abjure is oft en confused with adjure, which means "t o command solemnly, as if under oath." Thus, a judge mightadjure a criminal to change his ways; but it 's up to the criminal to abjure a life of crime.
 
==========perjury                        The crime of t elling a lie under oath.


?
 Found guilt y of perjury for lying under oath in front of a Congressional commit t ee, he was sent enced to two years in prison.


The prefix per- in Latin oft en meant "harmfully." So wit nesses who perjure themselves do harm to the truth by knowingly t elling a lie. Notall lying is perjury, only lying under oath; so perjury generally takes place either in court or before a legislat ive body such as Congress. To avoid commit t ing perjury, a wit ness or defendant may "take the Fifth": that is, refuse to answer a quest ion because the answer might be an admission of guilt , and the Fifth Amendment to the Const it ut ion forbids forcing a cit izen to admit to being guilt y of a crime.
 
==========de jure                      Based on or according to the law.


?
 The country is a de jure democracy, but since one part y controls all the media out let s itreally isn't one.


Coming straight from Latin, de jure is a t erm used most ly, but notalways, in legal writ ing. Somet imes it 's not enough to have something writ t en int o law; if a law isn't enforced, it mightas well not exist . And if ordinary cit izens are t oo scared of what would happen to them if they exercised their right s, then they don'treally have those right s atall. Unfort unat ely, many countries have const it ut ions and laws that sound good but t urn out not to have much effect . So de jure is almostalways used in contrast to something else; it s opposit e is de facto (see de fact o).

PENT comes from the Greek word for "five." The Pentagon in Washingt on, D.C., the world's largest office building, has five sides just like any other pentagon. And a pentatonic scale in music has only five not es, rather than the seven not es of the major or minor scale.
 
==========pentathlon                      An athlet ic cont est in which each athlet e compet es in five different event s.


?
 The modern Olympic pentathlon includes swimming, cross-country running, horseback riding, fencing, and target shoot ing.


The Greek word athlos means "cont est or trial," so to be an athlete you had to compet e in physical cont est s. The ancient Greek pentathlon t est ed warriors' skills in sprint ing, long jumping, javelin throwing, discus throwing, and wrest ling, none of which are part of t oday's Olympic pentathlon. Buta pentathlete must st ill have muscles and reflexes suit ed to almostany kind of physical feat . See also decathlon.
 
==========Pentat euch                        The first five books of the Old Testament , tradit ionally said to have been writ t en by Moses.


?
 The Pentat euch takes us from the creat ion of the world up to the Israelit es' arrival in the Promised Land.


Pentateuch means simply "five books." In Greek, the Pentat euch (which Jews call the Torah) includes the books of Genesis, Exodus, Levit icus, Numbers, and Deut eronomy. These contain some of the oldestand most famous st ories in the Bible, including those of Adam and Eve, Jacob and his brothers, and Moses, as well as some of the oldest codes of law known, including the Ten Commandment s.
 
==========pentamet er
 A line of poetry consist ing of five metrical feet .


?
 Shakespeare's tragedies are writ t en mainly in  blank  verse,  which  is  unrhymed  iambic pentamet er.


In a line of poetry writ t en in perfect iambic pentameter, there are five unstressed syllables, each of which is followed by a stressed syllable. Each pair of syllables is a metrical foot called an iamb. Much of the great est poetry in English has been writ t en in iambic pentamet er; Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milt on used it more than any other met er. Robert Frost 's line "I'm going out to clean the past ure spring" is an example of it ; his "And miles to go before I sleep" is inst ead an example of iambic tetrameter, with only four accent ed syllables.
 
==========Pent ecostal
Of or relat ing to any of various fundamentalist sect s that stress personal experience of God and vocal expression in worship.


?
 Their neighbors belonged to a Pent ecostal sectand, homeschooled their daught ers, who never wore clothes more revealing than floor-length skirt s and long pant s.


In ancient Greek, pentekoste meant "fift ieth day"-that is,  the  fift ieth  day  aft er  East er (count ing East er it self). On that day, Christ ians celebrat e an event described in the Bible that  t ook place fift y days aft er Christ 's resurrect ion, when the apost les heard the rush of a might y wind, saw t ongues of fire descending on them, and heard the Holy Spirit speaking from their own mouths but in other t ongues (languages). "Speaking in t ongues," when everyone in a congregat ion may begin talking in languages that no one can understand, is the best -known pract ice of Pentecostals. Pent ecostals belong to many different denominat ions; with growing numbers especially in Latin America and Africa, there may be over 500 million Pent ecostals worldwide.

==========quint essent ial
Represent ing the purest or most perfect example of something.


?
 As a boy, he had thought of st eak, eggs, and home fries as the quint essent ial Sat urday breakfast .


The philosophers and scient ist s of the ancient world and the Middle Ages believed that the world we inhabit  was ent irely made up of four element s: earth, air, fire, and wat er. Arist ot le added a fifth element , the aether or ether, by which he meant the mat erial that fills the rest of space, most ly invisibly but somet imes taking the form of stars and planet s. Many writ ers described the elementas a kind of invisible light or fire. In the Middle Ages, it was referred to as the quinta essentia ("fifth element "). It isn't surprising that the quinta essentia came to stand for anything so perfect that it seemed to surpass the limitat ions of earth. Today we generally use quintessential rather freely to describe justaboutanything thatrepresent s the best of it s kind.

BIO GEN FUNCT MUT FRACT TELE PHIL NEG DEC CENT NumberWords
Quiz19-1 Quiz19-2 Quiz19-3 Quiz19-4 Quiz19-5 ReviewQuizzes19

BIO comes from the Greek word for "life," and forms the base for many English words. Biology, for instance, is the st udy of living forms and life processes; the biosphere is the ent ire area of and above the earth where life can exist ; and biotechnology is the use of living organisms to creat e useful product s.
 
==========bionic                      Made stronger or more capable by electronic or mechanical devices.


?
 Bionic feetand hands for amput ees have ceased to be mere sci-fi fantasies and are becoming realit ies.


The science of bionics uses knowledge abouthow biological syst ems work to help solve engineering problems. The mat erial Velcro, for example, was inspired by the way burrs behave when they st ick to your clothes, and some comput er chips are now wired in ways that imitat e the "wiring" of the brain and nervous syst em. But in popular use, the adject ive bionic almostalways describes art ificial limbs or other bodily part s that work as much like real ones as possible. A perfect bionic arm would move and funct ion as easily as a real arm-a goal we're rapidly get t ing closer t o.
 
==========biopsy                         The removal and examinat ion of t issue, cells, or fluids from a living body.


?
 Everyone feltrelieved when the result s of the biopsy showed the t umor wasn't cancerous.


Mat t er examined in a biopsy is always taken from a living organism. Most biopsies are done by using a needle to extract t issue or fluid, but some may inst ead require cut t ing, and others may amount to nothing more than swabbing the inside of the pat ient 's cheek. Biopsies are best known as a means of det ect ing cancer, buta doct or may also take a biopsy of heart muscle to invest igat e suspect ed heart disease, for example, or perform a biopsy on a pregnant woman to t est for disorders in the fet us.
 
==========biodegradable
        Able to be broken down int o harmless substances by microorganisms or other living things.


?
 Though the advert isement s promised that the ent ire package was biodegradable, environmentalist s expressed their doubt s.


In biodegradable, with it s root grad, "t o st ep or move," and it s prefix de- "downward," we getan adject ive describing things that can be broken down int o basic substances through normal environmental processes. Animal and plant product s are normally biodegradable, but mineral substances such as metals, glass, and plast ics usually are not . Newly developed biodegradable plast ics are now appearing in numerous product s. However, "biodegradable" product s can vary great ly in how long they take to break down. A loaf of bread may require only a couple of weeks, and a piece of paper may vanish in a couple of months, but some "biodegradable" plast ic milk cart ons may take four or five years.
 
==========symbiosis
   (1) The close living t ogether of two different forms of life in a way that benefit s both. (2) A cooperat ive relat ionship bet ween two people or groups.


?
 The lichen that grows on rocks is produced by the symbiosis of a fungus and an alga, two very different organisms.


With  it s  prefix sym-,  "with," symbiosis expresses the not ion of  cooperat ion bet ween living things. Symbiotic associat ions are found throughout the plantand animal world. You may have read, for instance, of the lit t le blackbird plover, which picks the t eeth of the fierce African crocodile. Or the bird called the African honeyguide, which leads a lit t le mammal called the rat el to a bees' nest , which the rat el, prot ect ed from the bees by it s thick fur, then breaks open, and both itand the honeyguide feast on the honey. Or even our own bodies, which are home to millions of bact eria-especially the bact erium E. coli in our int est ines-and neither we nor E. coli could live without the other. You can probably think of plent y of human relat ionships that could be called symbiot ic as well.
 
==========GEN, which comes from the Greek genos, meaning "birth," has generated dozens of English words. A set of genes, for instance, gives birth to a living being. And a genealogy is a hist orical map of your family, showing how each generation gave birth to the next .
 
==========genesis                          Origin, beginning.


?
 The genesis of the project dat es back to 1976, when the two young men were roommat es at Cornell Universit y.


The tradit ional Greek name for the firstand best -known book of the Bible is Genesis, meaning "origin." Genesis t ells the st ories of the creat ion, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah's ark, the Tower of Babel, Abraham and his sons, and more-the st ories that explain how the world and humanit y were creat ed, as well as much abouthow humanit y, and especially the descendant s of Abraham, relat e to the rest of the world. Today we use genesis to refer to the creat ive beginnings of much smaller things, but never unimportant ones.
 
==========generat or A machine by which mechanical energy is changed int o electrical energy


?
 The jungle set t lement depended on a large generat or, which provided electricit y for a couple of hours each morning and evening.


Generat ors work by rotat ing a coil of wire in a magnet ic field, causing a current to flow in the wire. A generat or may be a huge spinning t urbine powered by wat er, wind, st eam, gas, or nuclear react ions, which sends electricit y out through power lines to thousands of cust omers. But normally when we use the word, we're thinking of a small machine powered by gasoline or diesel, such as you might keep in your basement for those t imes when a st orm knocks out your power, to creat e electricit y right in front of your eyes. A special kind of generat or called an alt ernat or powers a car's electrical syst em (including it s light s, power st eering, et c.) while the car is running.
 
==========genre               Kind, sort ; especially a dist inct ive t ype or cat egory of lit erat ure, art , or music.


?
 Opera was a new genre for her, since all her composit ions up unt il then had been songs and chamber music.


Genre, as you might guess from the way it sounds, comes straight from French, a language based on Latin. It 's closely relat ed to genus, a word you may have encount ered in biology class. Both words contain the gen-  root  because  they  indicat e  that  everything  in  a  part icular cat egory (a genre or a genus) belongs to the same "family" and thus has the same origins. So the main genres of classical music would include symphonies, sonatas, and opera, and the major genres of lit erat ure would include novels, short st ories, poetry, and drama. But within the cat egory of novels, we could also say that det ect ive novels, sci-fi novels, romance novels, and young-adult novels are separat e genres.
 
==========carcinogenic
      Producing or causing cancer.


?
 Although she knows all t oo well that the t obacco in cigaret t es is carcinogenic, she's t oo addict ed to quit .


It somet imes seems as if the list  of  carcinogenic  substances  get s  longer  every  day. A substance such as a food addit ive that 's been in common use for years may unexpect edly show signs of being carcinogenic in laborat ory experiment s. When thathappens,  the suspect ed carcinogen will oft en have to be  withdrawn  from the  market . When  a  building mat erial like asbest os t urns out to be a carcinogen, it may also have to be physically removed from buildings. English has hundreds of other scient ific words ending in -genic (such as allergenic), and in almostall of them the ending means "causing."

==========FUNCT comes from the Latin verb fungi, "t o perform, carry out ." If your car is functional, it 's able to perform it s function of providing transportat ion. Buta functional illiterate is a person who, for all pract ical or funct ional purposes, mightas well not be able to read or writ e atall.
 
==========funct ionary
 (1)  Someone  who  performs  a  certain  funct ion.  (2) Someone who holds a posit ion in a polit ical part y or government .


?
 He was one of a group of part y funct ionaries assigned to do the dirt y work of the campaign.


For most of us, being described as a functionary wouldn't be a compliment . The word refers especially to a person of lower rank, with lit t le or no authorit y, who must carry out someone else's orders. Bureaucrat is oft en a synonym. However, functionary can also refer to the world beyond governmentand offices; a charact er in  a  play,  for  example,  could  be  called  a funct ionary if it was obvious thather sole funct ion was to keep the plot moving.
 
==========malfunct ion
    To fail to operat e in the normal or usual manner.


?
 An examinat ion of the wreck revealed that the brakes may have malfunct ioned as the truck start ed down the hill.


A malfunct ioning swit ch might keep us from t urning on a light . A malfunct ioning heart valve mightrequire replacement with an art ificial valve, and if your immune syst em malfunct ions it may start to at tack healthy cells. And a malfunction in a vot ing machine could result in hundreds of vot es being miscount ed.
 
==========defunct No longer, living, exist ing, or funct ioning.


?
 The company, which had once had annual sales of $150 million, was now defunct .


If you know that de- oft en means "the opposit e of" (see DE), it 's easy to guess the meaning of defunct. Shakespeare seems to have been the first  writ er to use this adject ive, in Henry V. Defunctamerican polit ical part ies include the Greenback Part y, the Readjust er Part y, and the Nullifier Part y. Defunctacademy Awards cat egories include Best  Dance Direct ion and Bestassistant Direct or. Defunct U.S. aut o models include the Dudly Bug, the LuLu, the Hupmobile, the Gas-au-lec, and the Nu-Klea Starlit e. But to speak of a person as defunct would sound disrespect ful-which is how it sounds in e. e. cummings's famous poem "Buffalo Bill's defunct ."
 
==========dysfunct ional
      (1)  Showing  abnormal  or  unhealthy  behaviors  and at t it udes within a group of people. (2) Being unable to funct ion in a normal way.


?
 A psychologist would call their family dysfunct ional, but even though there's a lot of yelling and slamming of doors, they seem pret t y happy to me.


Dysfunctional and dysfunction have been used for almosta hundred years, oft en in medical writ ing ("brain dysfunct ion," "a dysfunct ional  liver")  but  also  by  social  scient ist s  ("a dysfunct ional cit y council," "diplomat ic dysfunct ion"). But they only really ent ered the general vocabulary in the 1980s, when therapist s and talk-show host s began talking about dysfunct ional families. The signs of family dysfunct ion t urned out to be numerous, and it soon began to seem as if pret t y much all our families could be called dysfunct ional.
 
==========MUT comes from the Latin mutare, "t o change." Plent y of science-fict ion movies-Godzilla, The Fly, The Incredible Shrinking Man-used to be made on the subject of weird mutations, changes in normal people or animals that usually end up causing death and destruct ion. What causes the unfort unat e vict im to mutate may be a myst erious or alien force, or perhaps invisible radiat ion. Though the science in these films isn'talways right on target , the scare fact or of an army of mutants can be hard to beat .
 
==========commut e                    (1) To exchange or subst it ut e; especially to change a penalt y to another one that is less severe. (2) To travel back and forth regularly.


?
 There was a public out cry at the harshness of the prison sent ence, and two days lat er the governor commut ed it to five years.


When you commut e bet ween a suburb  and  a  cit y, you're  "exchanging"  one  locat ion  for another. When a chief execut ive subst it ut es a life sent ence for the death sent ence handed down by a court , he or she is commut ing the original sent ence. Most such commutations are the result of the prisoner's good behavior. A commutator is a device in many electric mot ors thatregularly changes alt ernat ing current to direct current .
 
==========immutable
    Notable or liable to change.


?
 Early philosophers believed there was an immutable substance at the root of all exist ence.


Mutable means simply "changeable," so when the negat ive prefix im- is added we get it s opposit e. In comput er programming, an immutable object is one that can't be changed aft er it 's been creat ed. In a constant ly changing world, people who hunger for things as immutable as the laws of nat ure may try to observe an  immutable  moral  code  and  set  of  values. Unfort unat ely, immutability isn'ta basic qualit y of many things in this world.
 
==========permutat ion                         A  change   in   the   order  of   a   set   of   object s; rearrangement , variat ion.


?
 They had rearranged the rooms in the house plans four or five t imes already, but  the archit ecthad come up with yetanother permutat ion.


There are six permutat ions of the let t ers A, B, and C, select ed two ata t ime: AB, AC, BC, BA, CA, and CB. As you see, order is important in permutat ions. (By contrast , there are only three combinations: AB, AC, and BC.) Permutat ion is an important concept in mathemat ics, especially in the field of probabilit y. But we can use the word more generally to mean any change produced by rearranging exist ing part s without introducing new ones. Some soap operas, for example, love permutat ions; the cast of regulars is constant ly being rearranged int o new pairs, and even triangles.
 
==========transmut e                           (1) To change in shape, appearance, or nat ure, especially for the bet t er; to transform. (2) To experience such a change.


?
 Working alone in his clut t ered laborat ory in 15th-cent ury Milan, he spent t went y years searching for a method of transmut ing lead int o gold.


Transmutation changes something over int o something else. Thus, a writ er may transmut e his life int o st ories or novels, and an arranger might transmut e a lively march t une int o a quiet lullaby. In  the  "Myth  of  Er"  at  the  end  of  Plat o's Republic, for example, human  souls are transmut ed int o the body and exist ence of their choice. Having learned from their last life what they do not want to be, many choose transmutat ion int o something that seems bet t er. A meek man chooses to be transmut ed int o a t yrant , a farmer int o a dashing (but short -lived) warrior, and so on. But very few seem to have learned anything from their former life that would make their choice a real improvement .

==========FRACT  comes from the Latin verb frangere, "t o break or shat t er." A fraction is one of the pieces int o which a whole can be broken, and a fracture is a break in a wall, a rock, or a bone.
 
==========fract ious                           (1) Apt to cause trouble or be unruly. (2) St irring up quarrels; irritable.


?
 Shopping with a fract ious child is next to impossible.


One of the earliest meanings of fraction was "a break in good feeling"-that is, an argument or conflict . So a person who start s fight s could be called fract ious. A fract ious horse is one thathasn't been properly broken or trained. A fract ious polit ical part y is one whose members keep fight ing among themselves. And a fract ious baby is one that 's always breaking the home's peace and quiet with angry squalling.
 
==========fractal     An irregular shape that looks much the same atany scale on which it is examined.


?
 He was showing her the fractals in the local ferns, in which each leaf reproduced the shape of the ent ire fern.


This t erm was coined in 1975 to describe shapes that seem to existat both the small-scale and large-scale levels in the same nat ural object . Fractals can be seen in snowflakes, in which the microscopic crystals that make up a flake look much like the flake it self. They can also be seen in tree bark and in broccoli buds. Coast lines oft en represent fractals as well, being highly uneven at both a large scale and a very small scale. Fractal geometry has been important in many fields, including astronomy, physical chemistry, and fluid mechanics. And even some art ist s are benefit ing, creat ing beaut iful and int erest ing abstract designs by means of fractals.
 
==========infract ion
    The breaking of a law or a violat ion of another's right s.


?
 The assistant principal dealt with any st udent s who had commit t ed minor infract ions of the rules.


An infract ion is usually the breaking of a law, rule, or agreement . So a nat ion charged with an infract ion  of an  int ernat ional treaty will usually have to pay a  penalt y. In  Federal law, an infract ion is even smaller than a misdemeanor, and the only penalt y is a fine. Most of us occasionally commit infract ions of parking laws and get t icket ed; speeding t icket s are usually for infract ions as well, though they go on a permanentrecord and can end up cost ing you money for years to come. The closely relat ed word infringement generally refers to a violat ion of a right or privilege; use of another's writ ings without permission, for example, may be an infringement of the copyright .
 
==========refract ion                     The change of direct ion of a ray of light or wave of energy as it passes atan angle from one substance int o another in which it s speed is different .


?
 From where I was standing, the refract ion made it look as if her legs underwat er were half their act ual length.


The root of refraction is seen in the not ion that the path of a ray of light or wave of energy is "broken" when it is deflect ed or t urned. The effect s of refract ion can be seen in a rainbow, which is formed when lightrays passing int o (and reflect ing out of) wat er droplet s are bentat differentangles depending on their color, so that the light separat es int o bands of color. The amount of refract ion depends on the angle and the t ype of mat t er; refract ion can occur even when passing through different kinds of air. A mirage, such as you might see in the desert or over a pat ch of asphalt in the summer, occurs when light passing through warm air meet s the very hotair near the surface; reflect ing the sky, it oft en resembles a lake.
 
==========TELE has as it s basic meanings "distant " or "ata distance." A telescope is for looking at far-off object s; a camera's telephoto lens magnifies a distant scene for a phot ograph; and a television let s us wat ch things taking place far away.
 
==========t elegenic              Well-suit ed to appear  on  t elevision,  especially  by  having  an appearance and manner at tract ive to viewers.


?
 The local anchorpeople all have t elegenic faces and greathair, though they don'talways seem to know a lotabout the economy or polit ical science.


The word telegenic, a blend of "television" and "phot ogenic," firstappeared back in the 1930s, before hardly anyone owned a TV. With the supreme importance of TV cameras in polit ics, people running for polit ical office t oday worry about being t elegenic enough to have a successful career. Even event s have been described as t elegenic; unfort unat ely, such event s are oft en human tragedies, such as fires, earthquakes, or floods, which happen to broadcast well and capt ure the int erest of the viewers.
 
==========t eleological
 Showing  or relat ing to design  or purpose, especially in nat ure.


?
 Many nat uralist s object to the t eleological view that sees everything in nat ure as part of a grand design or plan.


Teleology has the basic meaning "the st udy of  ends or purposes."  So Arist ot le's famous "t eleological argument " claims thatanything complex musthave a creat or, and thus that God exist s. And a t eleological explanat ion of evolut ionary changes claims thatall such changes occur for a definit e purpose. But the t ype of moralit y called "t eleological ethics" doesn't involve God atall: inst ead, it claims that we should judge whether an act is good or bad by seeing if it produces a good or bad result , even if the act involves harming or killing another person.
 
==========t elemetry                       The science or process of measuring such things as pressure, speed, or t emperat ure, sending the result usually by radio to a distant stat ion, and recording the measurement s there.


?
 The t elemetry of the sat ellit e had gone dead in 1999, and it s fat e remains a myst ery.


Telemetry is used to obtain data on the int ernal funct ioning of missiles, rocket s, unmanned planes, sat ellit es, and probes, providing data on such fact ors as posit ion, alt it ude, and speed as well as condit ions like t emperat ure, air pressure, wind speed, and radiat ion. Weather forecast ers rely on t elemetry to map weather pat t erns. Astronaut s on the space shut t le are monit ored with t elemetry that measures and transmit s readings on their blood  pressure, respirat ion, and heartrat es. Similar kinds of t elemetry are used by biologist s to st udy animals in the wild and keep track of their populat ions and movement s. Telemetry is also widely used in modern agricult ure, oft en to regulat e irrigat ion.
 
==========t elecommut e                           To work at  home using an electronic link with a central office.


?
 A dozen of our employees are now t elecommut ing, and we calculat e thatalt ogether they're saving 25 gallons of gasoline and it s pollut ion every day.


This word has been around since the early 1970s, when comput er t erminals in the home first began to be connect ed to so-called mainframe  comput ers  by  t elephone  lines. Since  the creat ion of the World Wide Web in 1991, and with the widening access to broadband connect ions, t elecommut ing has grown to the point that the U.S. is now home to many millions of occasional telecommuters. Telecommut ing can make work much easier for people with young children and people with disabilit ies, and because of it s obvious environmental benefit s and the lessening of traffic congest ion, t elecommut ing is now officially encouraged by federal legislat ion. St ill, only a fract ion of those who could be t elecommut ing are act ually doing so.

==========PHIL comes from the Greek word meaning "love." In philosophy, it 's joined with sophia, "wisdom," so philosophy means lit erally "love of wisdom." When joined with biblio-, "book," the result is bibliophile, or "lover of books." And Philadelphia, containing the Greek word adelphos, "brother," was named by it s Quaker founder, William Penn, as the cit y of "brotherly love."
 
==========oenophile                      A person with an appreciat ion and usually knowledge of fine wine.


?
 As an amat eur oenophile, he was constant ly talking to his friends in the vocabulary of wine tast ing.


The root oeno- comes from  the  Greek  word  meaning  "wine."  The  oenophile  should  be dist inguished from the oenologist, or "st udent of wine," who has a t echnical knowledge of the cult ivat ion of wine grapes and of the whole winemaking process. Oenophiles may not know how to make a great wine, but they know one when they tast e it . Not only that , but they can describe it using nouns like nose, finish, and bouquet, as well as adject ives such as woody, full- bodied, robust, and noble.
 
==========philat elist
 A person who collect s or st udies stamps.


?
 The U.S. Postal Service issues first -day covers of each new stamp design especially for philat elist s.


The first postage stamps were made available on May 1, 1840, in England, and it didn't take long for the hobby of stamp collect ing to arise. Within a year, a young London lady was let t ing it be known in a newspaper advert isement that she was "desirous of covering her dressing room with cancelled postage stamps." Philately has been alive and well ever since, though modern philat elist s-including rock stars, English kings, and American president s-are more likely to put the stamps they collect in special albums.
 
==========Anglophile                          A person who great ly admires or favors England and English things.


?
 His grandparent s were Anglophiles, and whenever they had guest s in the aft ernoon the beaut iful silver t ea service would come out .


Even aft er fight ing two wars against Britain, Americans cont inued to regard England with more fondness than perhaps any other country. For much of our hist ory, Americans have sought to imitat e the Brit ish in any number of ways-American movie stars even used to adopt Brit ish accent s-and the two countries have long been close allies. But Britain isn't the only country Americans fall in love with; Francophiles (France-lovers), Germanophiles (Germany-lovers), and Italophiles (Italy-lovers) are also common. In the 19th cent ury, Russian Slavophiles called for reject ing European cult ure in favor of homegrown Russian cult ure (Slavs being those who speak a Slavic language such as Russian or Polish). Occasionally phil- words are t urned around; thus, someone who is philosemitic is a lover of Jewish cult ure.
 
==========philanthropy (1) A charitable act  or gift . (2) An organizat ion that distribut es or is support ed by charitable contribut ions.


?
 Her last philanthropy was dedicat ed to prot ect ing a vastarea in central Africa where many of the greatapes lived.


With  it s anthro-  root  (see ANTHROP) , philanthropy means lit erally "love of mankind." Thus, philanthropy is giving money for a purpose or cause benefit ing people who you don't personally know. (Animals are usually included as well.) Individuals have oft en set up their own permanent philanthropic organizat ions in the form of foundat ions. The great estamerican philanthropists have included Warren Buffet t , Bill Gat es, Andrew Carnegie, and John D. Rockefeller, but t ens of millions of us could be considered philanthropist s on a much smaller scale.
 
==========NEG and it s variant s nec- and ne- are prefixes of denial or refusal in Latin, and the Latin verb negare means "t o  say no." To negate something is to make it ineffect ive, and something negative denies, contradict s, refuses, or reverses.
 
==========negligent                     (1) Failing to take proper or normal care. (2) Marked by or likely to show neglect .


?
 The Army Corps of Engineers was found negligent for having failed to keep the New Orleans levees in good repair.


To be negligent is to be neglectful. Negligence  is an  important legal concept ; it 's usually defined as the failure to use the care thata normally careful person would in a given sit uat ion. Negligence is a common claim in lawsuit s regarding medical malpract ice, aut o accident s, and workplace injuries. But you can also be negligentaboutanswering your e-mail, or negligent in the way you dress. (The original garment called a negligee was worn by women who had neglect ed to get fully dressed.) The legal meanings of negligentand negligence, however, t end to be the ones we most oft en encount er nowadays.
 
==========abnegat ion
  Self-denial.


?
 She's been denying herself pleasures since she was a child, so she's act ually at tract ed by the life of abnegat ion thata nun leads.


Abnegat ion plays an important part in the t eachings of all the major religions. The founder of Buddhism was a prince who gave up all his worldly goods when he discovered the world of povert y that lay out side the palace gat es, and abnegat ion has been a Buddhism pract ice ever since. Hinduism has an even older tradit ion of abnegat ion. Special periods of abnegat ion and fast ing may even be included in a religion's yearly calendar; serious Christ ians give up some pleasure for the 40-day period of Lent , for instance, and Muslims are forbidden to eat during daylighthours during the month of Ramadan.
 
==========negligible
   So small as to be neglect ed or disregarded.


?
 Local weather forecast ers had made it sound like the blizzard of the cent ury, but the amount of snow t urned out to be negligible.


Negligible comes from the same Latin verb as neglect, so something negligible is lit erally "neglectable." If an accidentresult s in negligible damage to your car, you should be thankful. If two years of int ense focus on t est ing in the classroom result s in a negligible improvement in st udent t est scores, it 's probably t ime to try something new.
 
==========renege                  To go back on a promise or commit ment .


?
 If his part ners renege at this point , the whole project will probably fall through.


To renege on a bet is to refuse to pay up when you lose. To renege on a promise of marriage, or on a deal of any kind, is to pull out . Hist ory is full of promises and commit ment s and treat ies that were reneged on, such as the many treat ies with Nat ive Americans thatamerican set t lers and the U.S. government went back on over a period of almost 300 years. A synonym is welsh ("He always welshes on his deals"); however, since that word may have come from Welsh, meaning a nat ive of Wales in Britain, some people think it might be offensive.

?
 At 15 she post ed a decalogue of life rules on her bedroom door, start ing with "1. Be respect ful to t eachers."


In decalogue the root deca- is combined with logos, Greek for "word." In the Biblical book of Exodus, the original Decalogue, or Ten Commandment s, was handed to Moses by God at op Mount Sinai. In Jewish and Christ ian tradit ion, the Ten Commandment s are regarded as laws handed down from the highestauthorit y and as the foundat ion of moralit y. They include commands to honor God, the Sabbath day, and one's parent s, and bans on worshiping images, swearing, murder, adult ery, theft , lying about others, and envying what others have. Individuals have oft en had their own personal decalogues; Thomas Jefferson's "t en commandment s" start ed off with "Never put off t ill t omorrow what you can do t oday."
 
==========decathlon An athlet ic cont est made up of t en part s.


?
 Though the U.S. has dominat ed the Olympic decathlon for it s whole modern hist ory, the 1948 vict ory by the 17-year-old Bob Mathias st ill ast onished the world.


Decathlon from deca- and athlon,  "cont est ,"  means  "t en  cont est s."  The  ancient  Greek Olympics held five-cont est compet it ions, or pentathlons, that were based on the skills needed in bat t le. The modern Olympic decathlon, which was born in 1912, consist s of the 100-met er run, 400-met er run, 1500-met er run, 110-met er high hurdles, javelin throw, discus throw, shot put , pole vault , high jump, and long jump. The original winner was the legendary Jim Thorpe, who would lat er be judged the great estamerican athlet e of the 20th cent ury. And ever since,  the Olympic decathlon winner has been called the finestall-around athlet e in the world.
 
==========decibel                          A unit based on a scale ranging from 0 to about 130 used to measure the loudness of sound, with 0 indicat ing the least sound that can be heard and 130 the average level that causes pain.


?
 She worries about the damage thathigh decibel levels can cause, and always wears ear prot ect ion when mowing the lawn.


The bel in decibel honors the invent or of the t elephone, Alexander Graham Bell. Decibels work on a logarithmic scale (you may need to look up logarithm), so 20 decibels is 10 t imes as strong as 10 decibels, and 50 decibels is 1,000 t imes as strong as 20 decibels. The decibel readings of some everyday sounds make for int erest ing comparisons. Whispers and rust ling leaves usually regist er under 20 decibels, the average level of conversat ion is about 50 decibels, and noisy fact ories or office machinery may have decibel levels of 90 to 100. In the cat egory of sounds bet ween 100 and 120 decibels, which can event ually cause deafness, we find elevat ed trains, art illery-and rock concert s.
 
==========decimat e
 To reduce drast ically or destroy most of.


?
 Before the development s of modern medicine, diphtheria and t yphoid could decimat e the populat ions of ent ire t owns and cit ies.


Commanders in the Roman army t ook discipline seriously. Mut iny in the ranks was dealt with by select ing, through drawing lot s, one soldier in every t en and making the other nine club or st one the unfort unat e winner of this gruesome lot t ery to death. The dec- in decimate thus reflect s this Roman pract ice, which was ordered by such well-known leaders as Crassus, Mark Ant ony, and August us. But over t ime, the word's meaning has shift ed, and t oday italmostalways describes great destruct ion or loss of life. So, for example, we can say thata wave of layoffs has decimat ed a company's workforce, the populat ions of some of Africa's great est wild animals have been decimat ed by poaching, or  aerial bombardment  has  decimat ed  whole sect ions of a cit y.
 
==========CENT, from the Latin centum, means "one hundred." A dollar is made up of a hundred cents, though other monetary syst ems use centavos or centimes as the smallest coin. A centipede has whatappears to be a hundred feet , though the act ual number varies great ly. But there really are a hundred years in a century.
 
==========cent enary
     A 100th anniversary or the celebrat ion of it ; a cent ennial.


?
 The company is celebrat ing the cent enary of it s founding with a lavish banquet .


A centenary, like it s cousin centennial, is an anniversary. Thus, the year 2013 may mark the cent enary of a t own's founding, and the year-long calendar of public event s that the t own sponsors for the occasion-that is, the celebrat ion of the anniversary-can also be called a cent enary. Individuals have their own cent enaries, which usually celebrat e their births; thus, Gerald Ford's cent enary will occur in 2013, and John Kennedy's in 2017. And if you live long enough to be a centenarian, you'll be around to join the celebrat ions.
 
==========cent igrade
Relat ing to a t emperat ure scale in which 0 is the freezing point of wat er and 100 is it s boiling point .


?
 The normal t emperat ure of a human body is 37 cent igrade.


The cent igrade scale is essent ially ident ical to the Celsius scale, the standard scale by which t emperat ure is measured in most of the world. Anders Celsius of Sweden first devised the cent igrade scale in the early 18th century. But in his version, 100 marked the freezing point of wat er, and 0 it s boiling point . Lat er users found it less confusing to reverse these t wo. To convert Fahrenheit degrees to cent igrade, subtract  32  and  mult iply  by  5/9. To  convert cent igrade to Fahrenheit , mult iply by 9/5 and add 32.
 
==========cent imet er
  A length measuring 1/100th of a met er, or about 0.39 inch.


?
 There are 2.54 cent imet ers in an inch, 30.48 cent imet ers in a foot .


In the metric syst em, which is used in most countries of the world, each basic unit of measure of length, area, or volume can be divided int o cent imet ers. A met er consist s of 100 cent imet ers, a square met er consist s of 10,000 square cent imet ers, and a cubic met er consist s of 1,000,000 cubic cent imet ers.
 
==========cent urion
 The officer in command of a Roman cent ury, originally a troop of 100 soldiers.


?
 Cent urions and their cent uries were the backbone of the greatroman armies.


In ancientrome, a century was approximat ely equal to a company in the U.S. Army, and a cent urion was roughly equivalent to a captain. Cent urions play a role in the New Testament ; Jesus performs a miracle for a cent urion in Capernaum, cent urions are presentat the crucifixion, and in lat er years St . Paul is arrest ed by cent urions. According to a writ er of the t ime, cent urions were chosen for their size and strength, their abilit ies at  swordplay and at throwing missiles, and the qualit y of their discipline, which was part ly shown by how well their soldiers kept their own armor polished.

NOM PATER/PATR LEGA GREG FLU PREHEND/PREHENS TEMPER PURG MILL HEMI/SEMI
Number Words
Quiz20-1 Quiz20-2 Quiz20-3 Quiz20-4 Quiz20-5 ReviewQuizzes20

NOM comes from the Latin word for "name." A nominee is a person "named"-or nominated- to run for or serve in office. A binomial ("two names") is the scient ific name for a species: Felis catus for the house cat , for example. A polynomial, with "many names," is an algebra expression involving several t erms: 2x2 + 9y - z3, for instance.
 
==========nominal                          (1) Exist ing in name or form only and not in realit y. (2) So small as to be unimportant ; insignificant .


?
 The act or himself was the nominal author, but 90 percent of the prose was the work of his ghost writ er.


Something nominal exist s only in name. So the nominal ruler in a const it ut ional monarchy is the king or queen, but the real power is in the hands of the elect ed prime minist er. In the Unit ed Kingdom, the Brit ish monarch is also the nominal head of the Church of England; and those bapt ized in the Church who aren'treally churchgoers might be called nominal Christ ians. A fee can be called nominal when it 's small in comparison to the value of what it buys. So, for example, you might sell a friend a good piece of furnit ure for a nominal amount . And the charge for a doct or's visit might be a nominal $20, since most of the cost is covered by an insurance plan.
 
==========nomenclat ure
         (1) A name or designat ion, or the act of naming. (2) A syst em of t erms or symbols used in biology, where New Latin names are given to kinds and groups of animals and plant s.


?
 Naming newly discovered plant s or animals requires close st udy of the syst em of nomenclat ure.


Various specialized fields have their own part icular nomenclat ures, or set s of t erms. In part icle physics, for instance, the elementary part icles known as quarks, which are believed to come in pairs, have acquired such names as "up" and "down," "strange" and "charm," and "truth" and "beaut y"-which is all most of us know about quarks and all we need to know. But nomenclature is used most oft en for the syst em of biological classificat ion creat ed by Linnaeus. In Linnaeus's syst em, each species has it s own t wo-word name, the first word being the name of it s genus. Thus, the genus Equus includes the horse (Equus caballus) and the mountain zebra (Equus zebra). But since broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage act ually all belong to the  same  species (Brassica  oleracea),  they  each  need  a  third  name to dist inguish themselves.
 
==========ignominious (1)  Marked  with  shame  or  disgrace; dishonorable. (2) Humiliat ing or degrading.


?
 If At t ila the Hun was truly murdered by his bride on their wedding night , it  was a most ignominious death for a warrior.


The Latin nomen could mean both "name" and "good reputat ion," and even t oday we can say that someone who has been disgraced has "losthis good name." With it s negat ive prefix ig-, ignominious indicat es the "namelessness" that goes with shame or dishonor. A person who suffers an ignominious fat e may die nameless and forgot t en. In the former Soviet Union, part y leaders who fell out  of favor, even if  they avoided being imprisoned or execut ed, became nonpersons. Their names were removed from official records and hist ory books and they were treat ed as if they had never exist ed.
 
==========misnomer
    A wrong name, or the use of a wrong name.


?
 Calling the nat ive peoples of the west ern hemisphere "Indians" was one of the great misnomers in recorded hist ory.


Hist orians have long not ed that the Holy Roman Empire in it s lat er years was neither holy, Roman, nor an empire. The Bat t le of Bunker Hill was act ually fought on nearby Breed's Hill. And the famous Woodst ock Fest ival was act ually held in the t own of Bethel. But misnomers aren't limit ed to hist ory. The Pennsylvania Dut ch are act ually of German ancestry. Koala bears aren't bears-they're marsupials. And in the world of food, the Rocky Mountain oyst er, as diners have somet imes discovered t oo lat e, aren'treally oyst ers.
 
==========PATER/PATR comes from both the Greek and the Latin word for "father." So a patron, for example, is someone who assumes a fatherly role t oward an inst it ut ion or project or individual, giving moral and financial support .
 
==========patrician                          A person of high birth or of good breeding and cult ivat ion; an arist ocrat .


?
 They passed themselves off as patricians, and no one looked t oo closely at where their money came from.


A patrician was originally a descendant of one of the original cit izen families of ancientrome. Unt il about 350 B.C., only patricians could hold the office of senat or, consul, or pont ifex (priest ). Lat er, the word was applied to members of the  nobilit y  creat ed  by  the  Roman  emperor Constant ine. As t ime went by, other nobles, such as those in medieval Italian republics and in German cit y-stat es, also  came to be known  as patricians. Today someone's appearance, manners, or tast es can be described as patrician, whether the person is act ually of high birth or not . The actress Grace Kelly, an immigrant 's daught er, was admired for her patrician beaut y even before she became Princess Grace of Monaco, with classic feat ures worthy of ancientrome's finest sculpt ors.
 
==========patriarchy                           (1) A family, group, or government controlled by a man or a group of men. (2) A social syst em in which family members are relat ed to each other through their fathers.


?
 She spent the 1980s raging against the patriarchy, which she claimed had destroyed the lives of millions of women.


With it s root -arch, meaning "ruler, leader," a patriarch is a man who dominat es something, even if it 's justa family. In Christ ianit y, the t erm is used for a few leading figures who appear early in  the Old Testament , including Methuselah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; in the East ern Orthodox church, a patriarch is usually the equivalent of a bishop. Out side of the field of anthropology, patriarchy didn't start to be used much unt il the 1970s, when the women's movement gained a huge following. Many feminist s have claimed thatall West ern societ ies are patriarchal-that is, that they syst emat ically enable men to dominat e women. But there's plent y of disagreementabouthow this is done, and the word isn't discussed as oft en as it used to be.
 
==========expatriat e
      A person who has moved to a foreign land.


?
 As he got to know his fellow expatriat es in Morocco, he found himself wondering whathad led each of them to leave America.


Expatriate combines the prefix ex-, "out of" or "away from," with the Latin patria, "fatherland." A famous colony of expatriat es was the group of writ ers and art ist s who gathered in Paris bet ween the two world wars, including Ernesthemingway, F. Scot t Fit zgerald, and Gertrude St ein. Unlike an exile or an emigrant , an expatriat e's residence abroad is usually voluntary and ext ended but not permanent , and expatriat es-oft en called expats-generally keep their original   nat ional   ident it y   and   event ually   end   their   self-imposed   exiles   by repatriating themselves.
 
==========pat ernalist ic
    Tending to supply the needs of or regulat e the act ivit ies of those under one's control.


?
 Some st ill accuse the universit y of being t oo pat ernalist ic in regulat ing st udent living arrangement s.


A good father shows paternal concern abouthis children, justas a good mother oft en act s out o f maternal feeling. But paternalistic has a negat ive sound nowadays, since pat ernalist ic people or inst it ut ions seek-oft en with decent int ent ions-t o control many aspect s of the lives of those under their control. In the 19th cent ury, mill owners act ually oft en provided cheap housing for the mill's employees. Today companies frequent ly have strictrules regarding personal appearance, or against marriages within the company. Colleges and universit ies used to pract ice a kind of paternalism, especially in trying to keep men and women out of each other's dorms, buta changing societ y has most ly putan end to that .

==========LEGA comes from the Latin legare, meaning "t o appoint " or "t o send as a deput y." The same rootact ually shows up in such words as legal-but  how  the  law  connect s  with  sending deput ies can getawfully complicat ed and probably isn't worth going int o.
 
==========legat e                  An official representat ive, such as an ambassador.


?
 All the important European powers sent legat es of some kind to the peace conference.


Legate is a somewhat old-fashioned word, less used t oday than it was a cent ury ago. More common is the synonym envoy. In the days before electronic communicat ions, a legat e oft en had part icularly large responsibilit ies, since he couldn't check with his government to be sure he was doing the right thing. The Vat ican st ill sends papal legat es to represent the pope's point of view in negot iat ions.
 
==========legacy               (1) Something left to a person in a will. (2) Something handed down by an ancest or or predecessor or received from the past .


?
 The Stradivarius family of violin makers lefta priceless legacy of remarkable instrument s.


In it s basic meaning, a legacy is a gift of money or other personal propert y that 's grant ed by the t erms of a will-oft en a substant ial gift that needs to be properly managed. But the word is used much more broadly as well. So, for instance, much of West ern civilizat ion-law, philosophy, aesthet ics- could be called the undying legacy of ancient Greece. And the right s and opport unit ies that women enjoy t oday are part ly the legacy of the early suffragist s and feminist s.
 
==========delegat ion                         A group  of  people  chosen to represent  the  int erest s  or opinions of others.


?
 Each American colony senta delegat ion to the Second Cont inental Congress, and in it s second year all 56 delegat es approved Jefferson's Declarat ion of Independence.


The task of a delegat ion-each member of which can be called a delegate-is to representa larger group, oft en ata conference. Thus, a delegat ion of nondoct ors to a medical convent ion may want to make sure the right s and needs of pat ient s aren't ignored, justas a delegat ion of laypeople may at t end a religious conference to express the concerns of other laypeople.
 
==========relegat e                    (1) To remove or assign to a less important place. (2) To refer or hand over for decision or for carrying out .


?
 First -year st udent s were relegat ed to the back of the line so thatall the upper classes could eat first .


Originally relegate meant "t o send int o exile, banish." So when you relegat e an old sofa to the basement , you're sending it to home-decorat ing Siberia. When confront ed with a mat t er that no one really want s to face, a chief execut ive may relegat e it to a commit t ee "for further st udy," which may manage to ignore it for years. It may be annoying to read a newspaper art icle abouta pet projectand find that your own contribut ions have been relegat ed to a short sent ence near the end.
 
==========GREG comes from the Latin grex, "herd" or "flock." Bees, starlings, cows-any creat ures that like to live t ogether in flocks or herds-are called gregarious, and the same word is used for people who enjoy companionship and are happiest when they're in the middle of a rowdy herd.
 
==========aggregat e                          A collect ion or sum of unit s or part s.


?
 His lawyers realize that the aggregat e of incriminat ing details is now point ing t oward a convict ion.


An aggregat e is oft en an example of something being great er than the sum of it s part s. For instance, even if no individual element in a person's background would assure a criminal career, the aggregat e of fact ors could make a life of crime seem unavoidable. Aggregate is oft en used in the phrase "in the aggregat e," as in "Her achievement s were, in the aggregat e, impressive enough to earn her a scholarship." Aggregate is also an adject ive, meaning "t otal"; so, for instance, economist s oft en discuss aggregat e demand for goods and services in the country's economy, just  as you yourself might  speak about  your father's aggregat e income from his three jobs.
 
==========congregat ion
    (1) A gathering of people, especially for worship or religious instruct ion. (2) The membership of a church or t emple.


?
 That Sunday the congregat ion was especially large, and the minist er delivered one of his best sermons.


The verb congregate may be used for spontaneous gatherings. A crowd quickly congregat es at the scene of an accident , for example, justas cows, sheep, or horses t end to congregat e during a st orm. And under military rule, cit izens are oft en forbidden to congregat e on street corners or anywhere else. Buta congregat ion is generally a group thathas gathered for a formal purpose, usually in church. The Congregat ional Church was originally the church of the Puritan set t lers, in which each congregat ion governed it s own church independent of any higher authorit y.
 
==========egregious                        Standing out , especially in a bad way; flagrant .


?
 Many of the t erm papers contained egregious grammat ical errors.


Since egregious begins with a short version of ex-, meaning "out of," the word should mean lit erally "out of the herd." So something egregious possesses some qualit y that set s itapart from others. Originally, that dist inguishing qualit y was something good, but by the 16th cent ury the word's meaning had taken a U-t urn and the word was being applied to things that were outrageously bad. This has remained the most common sense. Thus, an egregious fool is one who manages to out do run-of-the-mill fools, and egregious rudeness set s a new standard for unpleasant salesclerks.
 
==========segregat e                           (1) To separat e from others or from the general mass; isolat e. (2) To separat e along racial lines.


?
 Some schools are experiment ing with gender segregat ion, claiming that both sexes learn bet t er in classrooms from which the other sex is absent .


The prefix se- means "apart ," so when you segregat e something you set itapart from the herd. The word t ypically means separat ing something undesirable from the healthy majorit y. During the apple harvest , damaged fruit is segregat ed from the main crop and used for cider. In prisons, hardened criminals are segregat ed from youthful offenders. Lepers used to be segregat ed from the general populat ion because they were thought to be highly infect ious. The opposit e of segregate is oft en integrate, and the two words were in the news almost daily for decades as African-Americans struggled to be admit t ed int o all-whit e schools and neighborhoods.

==========FLU comes from the Latin verb fluere, "t o flow." So a flume is a narrow gorge with a stream flowing through it . A fluent speaker is one from whom words flow easily. Influence originally referred to an invisible fluid that was believed to flow from the stars and to affect the act ions of humans. A myst erious out break of disease in 15th-cent ury Italy led Italians to blame it on the stars' influenza-and the name st uck.
 
==========affluence                          An abundance of wealth.


?
 The affluence of the cit y's northern suburbs is indicat ed by the huge houses there.


Affluence comes from the Latin verb affluere, "t o flow abundant ly."  Thus,  someone  or something blessed with affluence has received an incoming flood of riches. Since the affluentresident s of suburbs oft en work in the central cit y but pay taxes back home, the wealth of some metropolitan areas t ends to flow in one direct ion-out .
 
==========effluent                          Pollut ing wast e mat erial discharged int o the environment .


?
 The effluent from the mill had long ago t urned this once-beaut iful stream int o a foul-smelling open-air sewer.


Effluent comes from the Latin verb effluere, "t o flow out ." In an older meaning, an effluent was a stream flowing out of a river or lake. But nowadays effluentalmostalways means wast es that pour int o our wat er and air. Liquid fact ory wast e, smoke, and raw sewage can all be called effluent s. An effluent filt er keeps treat ed wast e flowing out of a sept ic tank from clogging up it s drainage pipes.
 
==========confluence                           (1) A coming or flowing t ogether at one point . (2) A place of meet ing, especially of two streams.


?
 The confluence of several large economic forces led to the "perfect st orm" that shook the world economy in 2008.


The joining of rivers-as atharpers Ferry, West Virginia, where the Shenandoah and Pot omac Rivers flow t ogether spectacularly-was the original meaning of confluence, and in it s lat er meanings we st ill hear a strong echo of the physical merging of wat ers. So t oday we can speak of a confluence of event s, a confluence of int erest s, a confluence of cult ures, and so on, from which something important oft en emerges.
 
==========mellifluous
     Flowing like honey; sweet ened as if with honey.


?
 His rich, mellifluous voice is familiar to us from count less voice-overs for commercials, stat ion breaks, and documentaries.


With it s root mel-, meaning "honey," mellifluous means lit erally "flowing like honey." The word usually applies to sound; ithas oft en been used to describe voices such as Renee Fleming's or Barbra Streisand's, or pieces by composers such as Ravel and Debussy. The DJ on a radio stat ion that plays soft music may have a voice so mellifluous that italmost put s the list ener to sleep.
 
==========PREHEND/PREHENS comes from the Latin verb prehendere, "t o seize." Most of the English words where itappears are closely relat ed to the ones discussed below.
 
==========prehensile
   Adapt ed for grasping, especially by wrapping around.


?
 The squid has eight short "arms" butalso two long prehensile t entacles that  it  uses for cat ching it s prey.


Howler monkeys are among the American monkeys with prehensile tails. Famous for their booming howls, howlers can wrap their tails around a nearby branch while using their prehensile feetand hands for picking lice from their fur or lobbing a coconutatan unwelcome t ourist . Our own hands are prehensile, of course. Our feetare not ; on the other hand, they're much bet t er for running than the prehensile feet of a monkey or ape.
 
==========apprehend
 (1) Arrest , seize. (2) Understand.


?
 It was a few minut es before she managed to apprehend the meaning of what she had just seen.


To apprehend is to seize, either physically or mentally. So to apprehend a thief is to nab him. But to apprehend a confusing news st ory, or to apprehend a difficult concept in physics, is to understand it -that is, to "grasp" it mentally. If you're apprehensive about something that 's about to happen, it means you've grasped all the unpleasant possibilit ies and are wait ing with anxiet y or dread.
 
==========comprehend                          (1) To grasp the meaning of; understand. (2) To take in or include.


?
 In the days following the dropping of the at omic bomb on Hiroshima, the public slowly began to comprehend the fact that the nuclear age had arrived.


To comprehend is to mentally grasp something's complet e nat ure or meaning. Comprehend is thus oft en a bit stronger than understand: for example, you may understand the instruct ions in a handbook without complet ely comprehending their purpose. Comprehend's second meaning is much less common. Using that sense of the word, we could say that good manners comprehends (that is, includes) more than simple table et iquet t e, for example, or that true courage comprehends more than just physical showing off. And something comprehensive includes a great deal: so a comprehensive exam, for instance, includes all the mat erial that was st udied in the course.
 
==========reprehensible
        Deserving st ern crit icism or blame.


?
 Whether or nothe ever broke the law, his treat ment of his first wife was thoroughly reprehensible.


From it s prefix re-, meaning "back," reprehend would mean lit erally "t o hold back, restrain"; but even the Latin version of the verb had come to mean "t o scold, blame"-in other words, to restrain bad behavior by expressing disapproval. Reprehensible is applied to both things and people-that is, both the sin and the sinner. So a senat or might be scolded for reprehensible conduct , but mightalso be called a thoroughly reprehensible person. And most of us would call dogfight ing morally reprehensible, and would use the same word to describe those who put the dogs up to it .

==========TEMPER comes from the Latin verb temperare, "t o moderat e or keep within limit s" or "t o mix." Most of the world's people live in the temperate zone-that is, the zone where the temperature is moderat e, bet ween the hot tropics and the icy Arct ic and Antarct ic Circles. It 's less easy to see how we get temperature from this root ; the word act ually used to refer to the mixing of different basic element s in the body, and only slowly came to mean how hot or cold that body was.
 
==========t emper              To dilut e, qualify, or soft en by adding something more agreeable; to moderat e.


?
 A wise parent t empers discipline with love.


The temper root keeps it s basic meaning-"t o mix" or "t o keep within limit s"-in the English word temper. When you t emper something, you mix it with some balancing qualit y or substance so as to avoid anything extreme. Thus, it 's oft en said thata judge must t emper just ice with mercy. Young people only gradually learn to t emper their nat ural enthusiasms with caut ion. And in dealing with others, we all try to t emper our honest y with sensit ivit y.
 
==========t emperance                   (1)  Moderat ion  in  sat isfying  appet it es  or  passions. (2)  The drinking of lit t le or no alcohol.


?
 Buddhism t eaches humankind to follow "the middle way"-that is, t emperance in all things.


Since temperance means basically "moderat ion," you mightassume that , with respect to alcohol, temperance would mean moderat e consumpt ion, or "social drinking." Inst ead, the word has usually meant the prohibit ion of all alcohol. To t emperance leaders such as Carry Nat ion, the safest form of drinking was no alcohol atall. Believing she was upholding the law, Nat ion began her hat chet -swinging at tacks on saloons, known as "hat chetat ions,"  in  the  1890s. Nat ional prohibit ion did event ually come-and go-but largely through the effort s of  more temperate (that is, moderat e) reformers.
 
==========int emperat e
      Not moderat e or mild; excessive, extreme.


?
 Lovers of fine wines and scot ches are almost never int emperat e drinkers.


Since the prefix in- generally means "not ," intemperate is the opposit e of temperate. Someone int emperat e reject s moderat ion in favor of excess. A religious fanat ic is likely to preach with int emperat e zeal, and a mean theat er crit ic may become int emperat e in her crit icism of a new play, filling her review with int emperat e language. And both temperate and intemperate also oft en refer to weather; a region with an int emperat e climat e isn't where all of us would choose to build a house.
 
==========dist emper                         (1) A highly contagious viral disease, especially of dogs. (2) A highly contagious and usually fatal viral disease, especially of cat s, marked by the destruct ion of whit e blood cells.


?
 An  epidemic  of  feline  dist emper  had  swept  the  country,  and  it s  cat  populat ion  had plummet ed.


Back when doct ors believed that  our moods were affect ed by an imbalance of myst erious fluids in the body, or "humors," dist emper oft en meant  moodiness, as when Shakespeare's Hamlet is asked "What is the source of your dist emper?
" Today the word is used only for true physical condit ions. The  dist emper  that  affect s  dogs, oft en  called  canine  dist emper, also affect s foxes, wolves, mink, raccoons, and ferret s. It  can be treat ed with medicat ion, but  is generally fatal if not treat ed. Dist emper in cat s, known as feline dist emper or panleukopenia, act ually isn'trelat ed to canine dist emper. If caught quickly, it  t oo can be treat ed. And both  t ypes  can  be  prevent ed  by  vaccinat ion, so  all  responsible  pet  owners  get  their  animals vaccinat ed.
 
==========PURG comes from the Latin verb purgare, "t o clean or cleanse." Almostall the English words where it shows up are closely relat ed to those discussed below.
 
==========purge     (1) To clear of guilt or sin. (2) To free of something unwant ed or considered impure.


?
 During the 1930s, Stalin purged the Soviet communist part y of thousands of members who he suspect ed of disloyalt y.


In some cult ures, a rit ual bath or prayer is performed to purge guilt or evil spirit s. The Minoans of ancient Cret e may have used human sacrifice as a way of purging the ent ire communit y, which is fine for the communit y butrough on the vict ims. In many cult ures, people periodically purge themselves physically-that is, clean out their  digest ive  tract s-by  taking  strong laxat ives; this used to be a popular springt ime rit ual, and herbal purgatives were readily available.
 
==========expurgat e                         To cleanse of something morally harmful or offensive; to remove object ionable part s from.


?
 In  those  years, high-school English  classes  only  used  expurgat ed  edit ions  of  Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales.


Expurgation has a long and quest ionable hist ory. Perhaps hist ory's most famous expurgator, or censor, was the English  edit or Thomas Bowdler, who in 1818 published the Family Shakespeare, an expurgat ed edit ion of Shakespeare's plays that omit t ed or changed any passages that , in Bowdler's opinion, couldn't decent ly be read aloud in a family. As a result , the t erm bowdlerize is now a synonym of expurgate.
 
==========purgat ive               (1)  Cleansing  or  purifying,  especially  from  sin.  (2)  Causing  a significant looseness of the bowels.


?
 I'm afraid my t en-year-old discovered the purgat ive effect of t oo many apples aft er a lazy aft ernoon in the orchard.


Purgative can be used as a noun as well as an adject ive. For cent uries, doct ors prescribed purgat ives-that is, laxat ives-for all kinds of ailment s, not knowing anything bet t er to do. Physical cleansing has always reminded people of emot ional and spirit ual cleansing, as expressed in the saying "Cleanliness is next to godliness." So we may say, for example, that confession has a purgat ive effect on the soul. Some psychologist s used to claim that expressing your anger is purgat ive; but in fact it may generally be no bet t er for your emot ional life than taking a laxat ive, and can somet imes really foul things up.
 
==========purgat ory
(1) According to Roman Catholic doctrine, the place where the souls of those who have died in God's grace must pay for their sins through suffering before ascending to heaven. (2) A place or stat e of t emporary suffering or misery.


?
 For both of them, filled with anxiet y, the long, sleepless night felt like purgat ory.


Purgatory is the place where the soul is cleansed of all impurit ies, as Dant e described in his great poem The Divine Comedy. Today purgatory can refer to any place or sit uat ion in which suffering and misery are felt to be sharp but t emporary. Wait ing to hear the result s of a t est , or whether you gota good job, can be a purgat ory. And an endless aft er-dinner speech can make an ent ire roomful of people feel as if they're in purgat ory.

MILL means either "a thousand" or "a thousandth." A millennium is a thousand years, and a million  is a  thousand  thousands. But  a milligram is  a  thousandth  of  a  gram, a milliliter a thousandth of a lit er, and a millimeter a thousandth of a met er.
 
==========millefleur                      Having a pat t ern of small flowers and plant s all over.


?
 She was painstakingly embroidering a millefleur pat t ern on a pillow casing.


Millefleur came int o French from the Latin mille florae ("a thousand flowers"), and from French direct ly int o English. You may have seen the famed Unicorn Tapestries, in which the unicorn is seen frolicking, relaxing, being hunt ed, and being caught , all againsta beaut iful millefleur background. Italian has given us the similar word millefiori; though fiori, like fleurs, means "flowers," millefiori act ually refers to a t ype of mult icolored ornamental glass. And the borrowed French word mille-feuille (feuille meaning "leaf") is the name of a dish made with puff pastry, the kind of pastry whose flakes resemble thin dry leaves.
 
==========millenarianism
             (1) Belief  in  the  1,000-year era  of  holiness foret old in the Book of Revelat ion. (2) Belief in an ideal societ y to come, especially one broughtabout by revolut ion.


?
 Millenarianism is one of the fut ure-orient ed beliefs common in the New Age movement .


Originally the millennium was not simply any thousand-year period, but inst ead the thousand years prophesied in the biblical Book of Revelat ion, when holiness will prevail on earth and Jesus Christ will preside over all. Lat er, millennium was ext ended to mean any period-always in the fut ure-marked by universal happiness and human perfect ion. On several occasions over the cent uries, members of Christ ian sect s have become convinced that the biblical millennium was arriving and gathered t ogether to await it . But nonreligious millenarians have also believed in a fut ure societ y marked by human perfect ion. Even if they regard this fut ure as certain, they've generally been willing to help italong by working for a polit ical, social, or economic revolut ion. The millennium always seems to be approaching; to dat e, ithasn'tarrived.
 
==========millipede                Any of a class of many-foot ed arthropods thathave a cylindrical, segment ed body with two pairs of legs on each segment , and, unlike cent ipedes, no poison fangs.


?
 As they t urned over rocks and bricks in their search for the lost bracelet , millipedes of various sizes went scurrying off.


The earth is home to about 10,000 species of millipedes. Though they have no poison fangs, many of them can, when threat ened, emita liquid or gas poisonous to their enemies. If their struct ure were true to their name, millipedes would have a thousand legs, but in fact they have far fewer. Even so, a millipede in mot ion is a sight to ponder: How can it possibly coordinat e all those legs so that it doesn't trip over it self?
 Like some t iny conga line or bunny hop, it scut t les away to a rhythm only it can hear.
 
==========millisecond
  One thousandth of a second.


?
 A light ning bolt last s only about 20 milliseconds, though the image may stay in one's eye for much longer.


A millisecond isn't long enough for the blink of an eye, buta few milliseconds may det ermine the winner of a swim race or a hundred-yard dash. With the ever-increasing speed of modern t echnology, even a millisecond has start ed to seem a lit t le sluggish; comput er operat ions are now measured in nanoseconds-that is, billionths of a second.
 
==========HEMI/SEMI means "half." Hemi- comes from Greek, semi- from Latin. A hemisphere is half a sphere, and a semicircle is half a circle. (The French prefix demi-, which probably developed from Latin as well, also means "half"-as in demitasse, a lit t le aft er-dinner coffee cup half the size of a regular cup.)
 
==========semit one
 The t one ata half st ep.


?
 The ancient piano in the great music room had been allowed to fall t erribly out of t une, with every not e at leasta semit one flat .


A semit one (somet imes called a half tone or a half step) is the distance from a whit e key to a neighboring black key on the piano keyboard-for example, from G to G-sharp or from E to E- flat . In an octave (from G to the next G above, for instance), there are t welve semit ones. Semit ones are the smallest int ervals thatare used int ent ionally in almostany of the music you'll normally hear. Two semit ones equal a whole tone-the distance from G up to A or from E down to D, for example.
 
==========semicolon The  punct uat ion  mark  ; , used  chiefly to separat e  major sent ence element s such as independent clauses.


?
 Some young vandal had done a search-and-replace on Mr. Marsh's comput er file, and in place of every semicolon was the myst erious message "Hendrix RULES!"


The semicolon was introduced int o modern t ype by an Italian print er around 1566. But since it 's act ually the same symbol as the ancient  Greek quest ion mark, it 's older than the colon (:), which firstappears around 1450. Don't mix the two up. A colon introduces something: usually a list , somet imes a stat ement . A semicolon separat es two independent butrelat ed clauses; it may also replace the comma to separat e it ems in a complicat ed list .
 
==========hemiplegia
Total or part ial paralysis of one side of the body thatresult s from disease of or injury to the mot or cent ers of the brain.


?
 She's start ing to regain the use of her righthand, and some of the therapist s think her hemiplegia might event ually be reversed.


Hemi-, unlike semi, almost  always appears in scient ific or t echnical words, including medical t erms such as this one. A hemiplegic, like a paraplegic (who has lost the use of both legs), has usually suffered brain damage, oft en from a wound or blood clot . Other condit ions thataffect one side of the body are hemihypertrophy (excessive growth  on  one  side), hemiatrophy (wast ing on one side), and hemiparesis (weakness or part ial paralysis).
 
==========semiconduct or
         A solid that conduct s electricit y like a metal athigh t emperat ures and insulat es like a nonmetal at low t emperat ures.


?
 Silicon, which makes up 25% of the earth's crust , is the most widely used semiconduct or, and as such has formed the basis for a revolut ion in human cult ure.


A  semiconduct or  is  a  crystal  mat erial  whose  abilit y to conduct  electricit y  rises  as  it s t emperat ure goes up. That is, it somet imes act s as a conduct or  and  somet imes  as  an insulat or. It s conduct ing abilit y can be much increased by chemical treat ment . A manufact ured chip of silicon, less than half an inch square, may contain millions of microscopic transist ors, which can serve control and memory funct ions when installed in a comput er, aut omobile, cell phone, DVD player, or microwave oven.

But subconscious thought does affect our feelings and behavior, and it 's oft en revealed in dreams, art ist ic expression, and slips of the t ongue. The subconscious mind can be a hiding place for anxiet y, a source of creat ivit y, and oft en the reason behind our own myst erious behavior.
 
==========subjugat e
 To bring under control and rule as a subject ; conquer, subdue.


?
 The country's government claimed it was just trying to prot ect nat ional securit y, but some saw it s act ions as an at t empt to subjugat e the news media.


Since jugus means "yoke" in Latin, subjugate means lit erally "bring under the yoke." Farmers control oxen by means of a heavy wooden yoke over their shoulders. In ancientrome, conquered soldiers, stripped of their uniforms, mightact ually be forced to pass under an ox yoke as a sign of submission to the Roman vict ors. Even withoutan  act ual yoke, whathappens to a populat ion thathas come under the control of another can be every bitas humiliat ing. In dozens of countries throughout the world, ethnic minorit ies are denied basic right s and view themselves as subjugat ed by their country's government , army, and police.
 
==========subliminal                    Not   quit e  strong  enough to be  sensed  or  perceived consciously.


?
 A few worried parent s claimed that some heavy-metal songs contain subliminal messages- in the form of words recorded backwards-that urge young fans to take up devil worship.


Since  the  Latin  word limen means "threshold,"  something subliminal exist s just  below  the threshold of conscious awareness. The classic example of a subliminal message is "Eat popcorn" flashed on a movie screen so quickly that the audience doesn't even not ice it consciously. Act ually, no such advert ising has ever been shown to work. But ordinary ads, both in printand on TV, do contain all kinds of images that shape our response to the product being advert ised even when we don'trealize it . Try looking carefully at some ads that you like, in order to discover how many ways they may be subliminally affect ing you.
 
==========subversion
 (1) An  at t empt to overthrow  a  government  by  working secret ly from within. (2) The corrupt ing of someone or something by weakening their morals, loyalt y, or faith.


?
 It 's somet imes easier for a government to combatat tack from out side than subversion from within.


Subversion is lit erally the "t urning over" of something. In the 1950s and '60s, many people worried about communist subversion of the U.S. government , though they oft en saw subversive act ivit ies where none exist ed. Nondemocrat ic government s oft en claim thatanyone who disagrees with them or joins a demonstrat ion is a subversive. But subversion isn'talways quit e so  serious a  mat t er; when  words like weekend, sandwich,  job, a n d camping start ed being used by the French, for example, some of them began claiming thatamerica was subverting their language.
 
==========HYPER is a Greek prefix that means "above or beyond," so hyper- oft en means about the same thing as super-. Hyperinflation is inflat ion that 's growing ata very high rat e. To be hypercritical or hypersensitive  is to be crit ical or sensit ive  beyond the normal. And if you hyperextend a knee or elbow, it means you're act ually bending it backward.
 
==========hyperact ive
     Excessively act ive.


?
 St ephen King's hyperact ive imaginat ion has produced dozens of fantast ical st ories, not to ment ion count less night mares in his readers.


For doct ors and psychologist s, hyperactive describes a condit ion with unpleasant consequences. Hyperact ive children usually have a very shortat t ent ion span and can't sit st ill, and hyperactivity can lead to difficult y in learning or just get them in trouble for dist urbing their classes. But not every high-spirit ed child is hyperact ive. Having a high energy level is pret t y normal for children, and some parent s think that prescribing drugs for hyperact ivit y is most ly just good for the drug companies.
 
==========hyperbole
   Extreme exaggerat ion.


?
 The food at Chez Pierre was good, but it couldn't live up to the hyperbole of the restaurant crit ics.


Advert isers and sport s commentat ors make their living by their skillful  use of  hyperbole. Present ing each year's Superbowl as "the great est cont est in the hist ory of sport s" certainly qualifies as hyperbole, especially since the final scores are usually so lopsided. Equally hyperbolic are advert isers' claims that this year's new car model is "the revolut ionary vehicle you've been wait ing for" when it 's barely different from last year's-which of course was once described in  the same  glowing  t erms. Polit icians love  hyperbole  t oo; some  of them seem convinced that calling a new bill "the worst bill ever passed by Congress" or comparing the president to Hit ler is a great way to win vot es.
 
==========hypert ension
     High blood pressure.


?
 Pregnancy is oft en accompanied by mild hypert ension that doesn't threat en the mother's life.


You mighthave thought thathypert ension was whata movie audience feels near the climax of a thriller, but you would have been wrong. High blood pressure-that is high pressure against the walls of your veins and art eries caused by blood flow-oft en occurs when the art eries or veins become blocked or narrowed, making the heart work harder to pump blood. But many cases seem to be the result of smoking or taking in t oo much salt , and many are genet ically caused. Hypert ension is serious, since it can lead to heartat tacks and strokes. Though it oft en produces no warning sympt oms, your blood pressure can be checked quickly and easily by a nurse. If it 's high, it can usually be controlled by st opping smoking, losing weight , lowering your salt intake, and exercising-and if all else fails, by medicat ion.
 
==========hypervent ilat e
        To breathe rapidly and deeply.


?
 They laughed so hard they began to hypervent ilat e and feel giddy.


Hyperventilating can be a response to fear and anxiet y. A t est pilot who panics and hypervent ilat es faces a dangerous sit uat ion. When the level of carbon dioxide in your blood goes down and the oxygen level goes up, blood vessels constrict because of the chemical changes and the body can't get enough oxygen (even though it 's there in the blood), and the pilot can become lightheaded and may even faint . To guard against this, pilot s are taught to control their breathing. On the ground, the usual remedy for hyperventilation is breathing int o a paper bag, which raises the level of carbon dioxide and rest ores normal breathing.

==========PRE, one of the most common of all English prefixes, comes from prae, the Latin word meaning "before" or "in front of." So a prediction forecast s what will happen before it occurs. The 5:00 TV news precedes the 6:00 news. And someone with a prejudice againsta class of people has judged them before having even met them.
 
==========preclude                      To make impossible beforehand; prevent .


?
 If we accept this cash offer from the company, that will preclude our joining in the big suitagainst it with the other invest ors.


Preclude is oft en used in legal writ ing, where it usually refers to making something legally impossible. A new law may be passed by Congress to preclude any suit s of a certain kind againsta federal agency, for example. Some judges have found that the warnings on cigaret t e packs preclude any suit s against the t obacco companies by lung-cancer sufferers. But there are plent y of nonlegal uses as well. Bad weather oft en precludes trips to the beach, and a lack of cash might preclude any beach vacat ion atall.
 
==========precocious                           Showing the qualit ies or abilit ies of an adultatan unusually early age.


?
 Everyone agrees that their seven-year-old daught er is smartand precocious, but she's also get t ing rather full of herself.


Growing from a child to an adult is like the slow ripening of fruit , and that 's the image that gave us precocious. The word is based on the Latin verb coquere, meaning "t o ripen" or "t o cook," but it comes most direct ly from the adject ive praecox, which means "ripening early or before it s t ime." Precocity can occasionally be annoying; but precocious children don't come precooked, only "preripened."
 
==========predispose
    (1) To influence in advance in order to creat e a part icular at t it ude. (2) To make one more likely to develop a part icular disease or physical condit ion.


?
 Growing up in a house full of sist ers had predisposed her to find her friendships with other women.


Predispose usually means put t ing someone in a frame of mind to be willing to do something. So a longt ime belief in the essent ial goodness of people, for example, will predispose us to trusta stranger. Teachers know that coming from a stable family  generally  predisposes children to learn. And viewing t elevision violence for years may leave young people with a predisposition to acceptreal violence as normal. The medical sense of the word is similar. Thus, a person's genes may predispose her to diabet es or arthrit is, and malnutrit ion over a long period can predispose you to all kinds of infect ions.
 
==========prerequisit e
   Something that is required in advance to achieve a goal or to carry outa funct ion.


?
 In most stat es, minimal insurance coverage is a prerequisit e for regist ering an aut omobile.


Prerequisite is part ly based on requirere, the Latin verb meaning "t o need or require." So a prerequisit e can be anything that must be accomplished or acquired before something else can be done. Possessing a valid credit card is a prerequisit e for rent ing a car. A physical exam may be a prerequisit e for receiving a life-insurance policy. And successful complet ion of an introduct ory course is oft en a prerequisit e for enrolling in a higher-level course.
 
==========PARA is a Greek prefix usually meaning "beside" or "closely relat ed t o." So parallel lines run beside each other. And a Greek paragraphos was originally a line writ t en beside the main t ext of a play to show where a new person begins speaking; t oday we just starta new paragraph on a new line.
 
==========paraphrase                   To restat e the meaning (of something writ t en or spoken) in different words.


?
 She start ed off the class by asking one of the st udent s to paraphrase the Tennyson poem, to make sure everyone underst ood it s basic meaning.


When we paraphrase, we provide a version that can exist beside the original (rather than replace it ). We paraphrase all the t ime. When you t ell a friend what someone else has said, you're almostalways paraphrasing, since you're notrepeat ing the exact words. If you go to hear a talk, you might paraphrase the speaker's main point s aft erward for your friends. And when writ ing a paper on a short st ory, you might start off your essay with a paraphrase of the plot . Paraphrasing is especially useful when dealing with poetry, since poet ic language is oft en difficultand poems may have meanings thatare hard to pin down.
 
==========paralegal
    Of, relat ing t o, or being a trained assistant to a lawyer.


?
 Part of the firm's business involved  researching real-estat e propert ies, which the senior lawyers regarded as paralegal work.


Much of the work in a law office can be done by paralegal assistant s, also called legal aides or simply paralegals, who work alongside licensed lawyers. Oft en a paralegal is trained in a narrow field and then entrust ed with it . In this respect , paralegals are similar to paraprofessionals in other fields, such as engineering. Paraprofessionals used to be trained in the office it self, but t oday it 's common to st udy for a paraprofessional cert ificat e or degree ata communit y college or universit y.
 
==========paramedic
  A specially trained medical t echnician licensed to provide a wide range of emergency services before or during transportat ion to a hospital.


?
 Five ambulances had already arrived, and a dozen paramedics were crouched over the vict ims with bandages and IVs.


In ground warfare, wounded troops must usually be transport ed from the front lines back to field hospitals, and trained paramedical personnel-that is, nondoct ors, usually known as medics or corpsmen-were first widely used in such sit uat ions. It t ook many decades for the wart ime model to be applied effect ively to ordinary peacet ime medicine. With advances in medical t echnology (such as defibrillat ors, for restart ing a heartaft er a heartat tack), paramedics  became  an  essent ial  part  of  emergency  medicine,  and  t oday  hundreds  of thousands of people owe their lives to paramedics. Paraprofessionals  who  work  only  in hospitals and clinics usually go by other t it les.
 
==========paramilitary
    Relat ing to a  force  formed  on  a  military  pat t ern, especially as a possible backup military force.


?
 In the country's mostremot e regions, the real power was held by large landowners, who act ually kept paramilitary forces, their own privat e armies, on their estat es.


This t erm paramilitary can take in a wide range of organizat ions, but is usually applied to forces formed by a government . Groups opposing a government , even when organized along military lines, are more oft en referred to as guerrillas or insurgent s. In countries with weak central government s (such as, in recent t imes, Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, or Congo), warlords may form their own paramilitary forces and take over all local police and military funct ions. Paramilitary oft en has a sinist er sound t oday, since it 's also applied to groups of off-dut y military or police personnel who carry out illegal violence, oft en at night , with the quiet support of a government .

==========META is a prefix in English that generally means "behind" or "beyond." In medicine, for example, the metacarpal bones are the hand bones that come rightaft er, or beyond, the carpal or wrist bones. And metalanguage is language used to talk about language, which requires going beyond normal language.
 
==========metadata
     Data that provides informat ion about other data.


?
 Before put t ing videos up on the Web sit e, she always tags them with a decent set of metadata.


Metadata is electronic data that somehow describes an electronic file or it s cont ent s, and is usually included in the file it self. An important use for metadata is for searching. A piece of metadata might ident ify the file, it s size, the dat e it was compiled, it s nat ure, and so on. Metadata is part icularly important for making pict ures searchable; since a pict ure of a landscape in the Southwest , for example, can't be "read" by a search engine, data tags such as "Southwest ," "mesa," and "arroyo" might be included in the digit ized image file. The same can be done for audio files; the tags for a speech mightread "Gore," "climat e," and "Copenhagen." Metadata tags for a Web page, including tags ident ifying it s most important cont ent , ensure that the page won't be overlooked by a search engine.
 
==========metaphorical                          Relat ing to a figure of speech in which a word or phrase meaning one kind of object or idea is used in place of another to suggesta similarit y bet ween them.


?
 He always point s out to his classes that metaphors can be found in poetry of all kinds, from "The eyes are the windows of the soul" to "You ain't nothin' buta hound dog."


Metaphor comes from a Greek word meaning "transfer" (or, to stay close to it s root s, "carry beyond"). Thus, a metaphor transfers the meaning  of  one  word  or  phrase to another. Metaphors oft en include a form of the verb be (as in the examples above), and they're oft en contrast ed with similes, which are usually introduced by like or as ("O, my luve's like a red, red rose"). But , they don'thave to include be; when you say that the t eacher gave us a mountain of homework or that we're drowning in paperwork, these t oo are metaphorical stat ement s.
 
==========metaphysics                          The  part  of  philosophy  having to do  with  the  ult imat e causes and basic nat ure of things.


?
 Most of the congregat ion prefers to hear their minist er preach about virt ue, and they getrest less when his sermons head in the direct ion of metaphysics.


Justas physics deals with the laws that govern the physical world (such as those of gravit y or the propert ies of waves), metaphysics describes what is beyond physics-the nat ure and origin of realit y it self, the immortal soul, and the exist ence of a supreme being. Opinions about these metaphysical t opics vary widely, since what 's being discussed can't be observed or measured or even truly known to exist . So most metaphysical quest ions are st ill as far from a final answer as they were when Plat o and Arist ot le were asking them.
 
==========met onymy
A figure of speech in which the name of one thing is used for the name of something else that is associat ed with it or relat ed to it .


?
 When Wall Streethas the jit t ers, the Whit e House issues a stat ement , and the people wait for answers from Cit y Hall, met onymy is having a busy day.


At first glance, metaphor and metonymy seem close in meaning, but there are differences. In a metaphor we subst it ut e one thing for something else that 's usually quit e different ; for example, Web for a worldwide net work of linked comput ers and their t echnology. In met onymy, we replace one word or phrase (such as "st ock market "  or "local government officials"  in the examples above) with another word or phrase associat ed with it . Most familiar metonyms are place-names, such as Hollywood for "the film industry," or K Street for "Washingt on lobbyist s." But saying "the press" to refer to the news media, or "sweat " to refer to hard work, could also be called met onymy.
 
==========PER is a Latin preposit ion that generally means "through," "throughout ," or "thoroughly." Thus, perforate means "t o bore through," perennial means "throughout the years," and permanent means  "remaining  throughout ."  And  the  "thoroughly"  sense  shows  up  in persuade,  for "thoroughly advise," and perverted, "thoroughly t urned around."
 
==========percolat e                    (1) To trickle or filt er through something porous. (2) To become spread through.


?
 She t ells herself that the money she spends on luxuries event ually percolat es down to the needy.


Percolate comes from a Latin verb meaning "t o put through a  sieve."  Something  that percolat es filt ers through something else, justas small part icles pass through a sieve. Wat er is drawn downward through the soil, and this percolation usually cleans the wat er. A slow rain is ideal for percolat ing int o the soil, since in a violentrainst orm most of it quickly runs off. For this reason, drip irrigat ion is the most effect ive and wat er-conserving form of irrigat ion. Percolat ion isn'talways a physical process; awareness of an issue may percolat e slowly int o the minds of the public, justas Spanish words may gradually percolat e int o English, oft en start ing in the Southwest .
 
==========pervade                       To spread through all part s of something.


?
 We all knew that more job cut s were coming, and the ent ire office was pervaded with anxiet y.


Pervade can be used to describe something physical: a chemical odor may pervade a building, for example, and most scient ist s believe that out er space is pervaded by myst erious "dark mat t er." But the word usually doesn'trefer to anything that could be det ect ed by scient ific instrument s. Thus, humor may pervade a novel, gloom may pervade  a  gathering,  and corrupt ion may pervade a government . And something pervasive exist s in  every  part  of something: fatherlessness may be a pervasive problem in poor neighborhoods, for instance, and pervasive opt imism somet imes causes the st ock market to soar.
 
==========permeat e                (1) To spread throughout . (2) To pass through the pores or small openings of.


?
 On Sat urday mornings back in those days, the aroma of fresh pies and  breads  would permeat e almost every house on the block.


Permeate is oft en a synonym for pervade. We could say, for example, thatat exam t ime the campus is either "permeat ed" or "pervaded" by a sense of dread. But the two words aren't ident ical. For one thing, permeate can mean simply "pass through," and is oft en used when talking about liquids; thus, a boot can be permeat ed by wat er, though certain oils make leather less permeable, and you might  just  want to buy boot s made of impermeable mat erial. And things may "pass through" in a nonphysical way as well; so you might say thatanxiet y about climat e change has start ed to permeat e int o the public's consciousness-but once anxiet y has become pervasive it 's pret t y much taken over.
 
==========persevere       To  keep  at  something  in  spit e  of  difficult ies,  opposit ion,  or discouragement .


?
 For t en years she persevered in her effort to find out what the government knew abouther husband's disappearance.


The early set t lers of the New World persevered in the face of constanthardship and danger. The Pilgrims of Plymouth Plantat ion losthalf their number in the first wint er to disease and hunger, but their perseverance paid off, and within five years their communit y was healthy and self-sufficient . Perhaps more remarkable are all the solitary invent ors who have persevered in pursuing their visions for years, lacking any financial supportand laughed at by the public.

==========antagonist                      A person who opposes or is unfriendly t oward another; an opponent .


?
 With supplies ordered from the Acme Company, Road Runner's constantantagonist , Wile E. Coyot e, at t empt s one dastardly deed aft er another.


On the stage or screen, in a st ory or a novel, the protagonist is the main charact er and the antagonist is the opposing one. Pro- and ant- usually mark the good and bad charact ers, but notalways; there may occasionally be an evil protagonistand a good antagonist . In the drama of the real world, it 's especially hard to sort out which is which, so we usually speak of both part ies to a conflictas antagonist s. During a strike, for example, representat ives of labor and management become antagonist s; they oft en manage to antagonize each other, and the antagonism oft en remains aft er the strike is over.
 
==========ant igen                         A chemical substance (such as a prot ein) that , when introduced int o the body, causes the body to form ant ibodies against it .


?
 When the immune syst em is weak, it may not be able to produce enough ant ibodies to combat the invading ant igens.


An antibody is a prot ein produced by your immune syst em to fight out side invaders. Since the enemy substance act ually triggers the product ion of ant ibodies, such substances are called ant igens-anti- being short for antibody, and -gen meaning "producer." (In a similar way, an allergen produces an allergy, and a pathogen produces a pathology or disease.) Ant igens are oft en rodlike struct ures that st ick out from the surface of an invading organism-usually a bact erium or a virus-and allow it to at tach it self to cells in the invaded body. But unfort unat ely for them, in doing so they let the immune syst em know they're present , and the body is flooded with an army of Pac-Man-like ant ibodies.
 
==========ant ipathy
   A strong dislike.


?
 It seemed odd thathe could feel such int ense ant ipathy for someone he'd only met once, and we suspect ed there was more to the st ory.


When the nat ion of Yugoslavia was creat ed in 1945, it combined a number of ethnic groups with a hist ory of violentant ipathy t oward each other. In 1991-92 four regions of the country announced that they would become independent nat ions; a bloody six-year war followed, fueled by these ancientand powerful ant ipathies. The American Civil War similarly result ed from ant ipathy bet ween the North and the South. But in the U.S.'s relat ions with it s next -door neighbors, it 's been a long t ime since emot ions have got t en much stronger than annoyance.
 
==========ant ithesis
      (1) The contrast or opposit ion of ideas. (2) The exact opposit e.


?
 Life on the small college  campus, with  it s personal freedom and  responsibilit y, was the ant ithesis of what many st udent s had known in high school.


Writ ers and speechmakers use the tradit ional pat t ern known as ant ithesis for it s resounding effect ; John Kennedy's famous "ask not what your country can do for you-ask what you can do for your country" is an example. Butantithesis normally means simply "opposit e." Thus, war is the ant ithesis of peace, wealth is the ant ithesis of povert y, and love is the ant ithesis of hat e. Holding two antithetical ideas in one's head at the same t ime-for example, that you're the sole mast er of your fat e butalso the helpless vict im of your t errible upbringing-is so common as to be almost normal.
 
==========CONTRA is the Latin equivalent of anti-, and it t oo means essent ially "against " or "contrary t o." A contrast "stands against " something else that it 's compared t o.

      Goods thatare forbidden by law to be owned or brought int o or out of a country; smuggled goods.


?
 Lat e at nighthe would go  driving  through  the  desert  on  the  int erstat e, peddling  his contraband to wary gas-stat ion at t endant s.


In Latin a bannus was  an order or decree, so a contrabannum was something that wentagainsta decree. This led to the Italian word contrabbando, from which we get contraband. Contraband it ems aren'talways illegal; they may simply be things (such as cigaret t es) thatare meant to be taxed. So a dealer in untaxed contraband can charge a lit t le less and st ill make enormous profit s. Of course, if the it em is act ually forbidden, like illegal drugs, then the profit s could be much great er.
 
==========contraindicat ion
                Something  (such   as  a   sympt om  or condit ion) that makes a part icular treat ment , medicat ion, or procedure likely to be unsafe.


?
 A hist ory of st omach ulcers is a contraindicat ion to regular use of aspirin.


For  doct ors,  an indication  is  a  sympt om or circumstance  that  makes a  part icular medical treat ment  desirable. Serious  anxiet y, for  example, is  oft en  an  indicat ion  for  prescribing  a tranquilizer. A contraindicat ion, then, is a sympt om or condit ion that makes a treat mentrisky, such as taking certain other medicat ions at the same t ime. Drugs and condit ions thatare contraindicated for a medicat ion are list ed on it s label, and reeled off athigh speed in TV ads. Pat ient s can guard against the dangers of drug int eract ion by reading labels carefully and making sure their doct ors know what else they're current ly taking.
 
==========contravene
    (1) To go against or act contrary t o; to violat e. (2) To oppose in an argument , to contradict .


?
 The power  company  was  found to be  contravening  stat e  and  federal  environmental standards for wast ewat er discharged int o bodies of wat er.


Contravene is most oft en used in reference to laws. So a government may take a company to court claiming that it s policies are in contravention of nat ional labor laws. The contravent ion of copyright laws is a big t opic t oday especially where electronic informat ion is involved. And a country might  be punished if a trade organizat ion finds that  it 's contravening int ernat ional trade agreement s.
 
==========contrarian
     A person who takes a contrary posit ion or at t it ude, especially an invest or who buys shares of st ock when most others are selling or sells when others are buying.


?
 My father was basically a contrarian, who never accept ed the common wisdom and loved nothing so much as a good argument .


Anyone who thinks that most of what the public believes is wrong would be called a contrarian. And contrarian is a basic t erm in the vocabulary of invest ing. In fact , most successful invest ors oft en behave like contrarians by "buying low and selling high"-that is, buying st ocks thatare cheap because most invest ors puta low value on them but thathave the possibilit y of rising, and selling st ocks that most invest ors are valuing highly but that seem likely to decline. The word may be most common as an adject ive; so you may express a contrarian opinion, hold a contrarian view, or pursue a contrarian invest ment strat egy.

==========Greek and Latin Borrowings

in memoriam
       In memory of.


?
 The message on the pedestal begins "In memoriam" and then list s the names of the local young men who died in World War I.


Since the days of the Roman empire, the words In memoriam, followed by a name, have been found on monument s and gravest ones. They may also appear in the dedicat ion of a book or poem; Alfred Tennyson's great est poem is his immense In Memoriam, writ t en over a period of 17 years to mourn the death of his dear friend Arthur Hallam.
 
==========magnum opus
     A great work, especially the great estachievement of an art ist , composer, or writ er.


?
 No one was exact ly sure what the massive novel was about , but everyone was certain that it was his magnum opus.


The great est work of a greatart ist may be hard to agree on. Many would pick Rembrandt 's The Night Watch, Mozart 's Don Giovanni, Ovid's Metamorphoses, Dant e's Divine Comedy, Wren's St . Paul's Cathedral, and Michelangelo's Sist ine Chapel murals. But  for Shakespeare, would it be Hamlet or King Lear?
 For Mahler, The Song of the Earth or the Ninth Symphony?
 For the Marx Brothers, A Day at the Races or A Nightat the Opera?

 
==========mement o mori
 A reminder of mortalit y, especially a human skull symbolizing death.


?
 The first t winges of arthrit is oft en serve as a vivid mement o mori for middle-aged jocks trying to ignore their advancing years.


Memento mori lit erally means "Remember you  must  die."  The  early  Puritan  set t lers  were part icularly aware of death and fearful of what it might mean, so a Puritan t ombst one will oft en display a mement o mori int ended for the living. These death's-heads or skulls may strike us as ghoulish, but they helped keep the living on the straightand narrow for  fear of et ernal punishment . In earlier cent uries, an educat ed European might place an act ual skull on his desk to keep the idea of death always present in his mind.
 
==========habeas corpus
    An order to bring a jailed person before a judge or court to find out if that person should really be in jail.


?
 The country has a primit ive legal syst em with no right of habeas corpus, and suspect s oft en are shot before they ever see a judge.


The lit eral meaning of habeas corpus is "You shall have the body"-that is, the judge musthave the person charged with a crime brought int o the courtroom to hear whathe's been charged with. Through much of human hist ory, and in many countries st ill t oday, a person may be imprisoned on the orders of someone in the governmentand kept behind bars for years without ever get t ing a chance to defend himself, or even knowing whathe's done wrong. In England, the right to be brought before a judge to hear the charges and answer them was writ t en int o law over 300 years ago, and the  U.S.  adopt ed  the  Brit ish  pract ice  in  it s Const it ut ion.
 
==========rigor mort is
  The t emporary rigidit y of muscles that set s in aft er death.


?
 The coroner could t ell from the progress of rigor mort is that death had occurred no more than six hours earlier.


Rigor mortis, which translat es from Latin as "st iffness of death," set s in quickly and usually ends three or four days aft er death. The condit ion result s from a lack of certain chemicals in the muscles; it  may be affect ed by muscular act ivit y before death as well as the ext ernal t emperat ure. Myst ery writ ers frequent ly make use of rigor mort is as a means by which the det ect ive or the examiner can det ermine the t ime of the vict im's death, which oft en t urns out to be all-important in solving the case.
 
==========sine qua non
  An essent ial thing.


?
 Good planning is the sine qua non of a successful dinner part y.


Sine qua non can be translat ed lit erally as "Without which, not ." Though this may sound like gibberish, it means more or less "Without (something), (something else) won't be possible." Sine qua non sounds slight ly lit erary, and it shouldn't be used justanywhere. But itact ually shows up in many cont ext s, including business ("A solid cust omer base is the sine qua non to success"), show business ("A good agent is a sine qua non for an act or's career"), and polit ics ("His support was really the sine qua non for her candidacy").
 
==========tabula  rasa
(1)  The  mind  in  it s  blank  or  unmarked  stat e  before receiving any impressions from out side. (2) Something exist ing in it s original pure stat e.


?
 As for knowing what life out side of his lit t le village was like, he was pract ically a tabula rasa.


In ancientrome, a st udent in class would writ e on a wax-covered wooden tablet , or tabula, using a st icklike implement . At the end of the day, the marks could be scraped off, leaving a fresh, unmarked tablet -a tabula rasa-for the next day's lessons. But even before the Romans, the Greek philosopher Arist ot le had called the mind at birth an "unmarked tablet ." We st ill use the t erm t oday, but usually not very seriously; with what we know about biology and genet ics, most of us don'treally think there's nothing in a mind at birth.
 
==========t erra incognita
             An unexplored country or field of knowledge.


?
 We've been to Phoenix once, but otherwise Arizona is t erra incognita.


When Roman mapmakers drew a land area that no one had yet explored, they oft en labeled it "Terra Incognita"-that is, "Unknown Territ ory"-and the  t erm  cont inued to be  used  for cent uries aft erward. When Columbus and  his  successors  first  crossed  the At lant ic, they ent ered upon t erra incognita, a land that came to be called the "New World." But the t erm is justas useful for mental explorat ion. For most of us, subject s such as part icle physics, French 17th-cent ury drama, and soil mechanics are t erra incognita, and we can only hope to live long enough to be able to explore some of them someday.

ACER/ACR STRICT STRU/STRUCT PROP/PROPRI TORT VIV SERV CLUS GreekandLatin
Borrowings
Quiz22-1 Quiz22-2 Quiz22-3 Quiz22-4 Quiz22-5 ReviewQuizzes22

ACER/ACR comes from the Latin adject ive acer, meaning "sharp" or "sour." Grapefruitand limes have an acid tast e; acid can also describe a person's sense of humor (other words for it might be sharp or biting). The acidity of the soil oft en indicat es whether it 's good for growing certain crops; blueberries, for instance, love acid soil, so they're more likely to be found east of the Mississippi River, where acid soil is the rule.
 
==========acerbic                         Sharp or bit ing in t emper, mood, or t one.


?
 She had enjoyed his acerbic humor for years, but then a friend t old her about the nast y jokes he was making abouther behind her back.


Acerbic oft en describes wit . An acerbic crit ic won't make many friends among the writ ers or art ist s whose work is  being  crit icized, but  oft en  keeps  his  or  her  readers  amused  and ent ertained. Acerbity may be slight ly less sharp than sarcasm, but not much; both words have root s meaning basically "cut ."
 
==========acrid                    Unpleasant ly sharp and harsh; bit t er.


?
 The acrid odor of gunpowder hung in the air long aft er the shot s' echoes had died away.


Acrid exact ly fit s the smoke from a fire-a burning building or forest , for example. Dense smog may castan acrid pall over a cit y, making throat s burn and eyes st ing. But , like acid and acerbic, acrid somet imes also describes nonphysical things, such as the remarks of a bit t er person.
 
==========acrimony
      Harsh or bit t er sharpness in words, manner, or t emper.


?
 Town meet ings here were usually civilized, and no one could recall an issue thathad ever aroused such int ense acrimony as the new pulp mill.


Acrimony is angry harshness that usually springs from int ense personal dislike. An acrimonious exchange is full of cut t ing, unpleasantremarks designed to hurt . Civil wars are oft en more acrimonious and bloody than foreign wars. In the same way, a bad divorce may be more acrimonious than any other kind of legal bat t le.
 
==========exacerbat e
To make worse, more violent , or more severe.


?
 The increase in coal-burning power plant s has great ly exacerbat ed the buildup of greenhouse gases.


To exacerbat e is not to cause, but only to make something bad even worse. So the loss of a major industry in a cit y may exacerbat e it s already serious unemployment problem. A vicious remark can exacerbat e a quarrel. Building a new mall may exacerbat e an area's exist ing traffic problems. A new drug can exacerbat e the side effect s of the drug a pat ient is already taking. It used to be thought that t oo much blood in the body exacerbat ed a fever, so the pat ient 's blood would be drained, oft en by means of leeches-and notall pat ient s survived.
 
==========STRICT comes from the Latin verb meaning "t o draw t ight , bind, or t ie." So the English word strict means "t ight ly controlled." And when someone begins a sent ence "Strict ly speaking, . . ." you know he or she is going to be talking abouta word or idea in it s most limit ed sense, "drawing t ight " the meaning t ill it 's as narrow as possible.
 
==========strict ure                          (1) A law or rule that limit s or controls something; restrict ion. (2) A strong crit icism.


?
 There are severe legal strict ures on the selling of marijuana in almost every stat e.


Stricture has meant many things through the cent uries, and it s "restrict ion" meaning-probably the most  common one t oday-is act ually the most  recent . High-school t eachers oft en put strict ures on t ext ing during class. Cit ies concerned about their murder rat e have slapped strict ures on the possession of handguns. And the Unit ed Nat ions may vot e to put strict ures on arms sales to a  country  that  keeps  violat ing  int ernat ional treat ies. With  the  meaning "strong crit icism," stricture is slight ly old-fashioned t oday, but it 's st ill used by int ellect uals. So, for example, an art icle may amount to a harsh strict ure on the whole medical profession, or an artreview may just express the crit ic's strict ures on sent imental paint ings of cut e lit t le houses with glowing windows.
 
==========restrict ive                   (1) Serving or likely to keep within bounds. (2) Serving or t ending to place under limit s as to use.


?
 The deed to the propert y had a restrict ive covenant forbidding any development of the land for 50 years.


Restrict ive covenant s (that is, agreement s) in real-estat e deeds were once used to forbid the buyer from ever selling the propert y to anyone of another race. These are now illegal, though other kinds of restrict ive covenant s are very common; in some neighborhoods, they may even t ell you what colors you can't paint your house. In grammar, a restrict ive clause is one that limit s the meaning of something that comes before it . In the sent ence "That 's the professor who I'm trying to avoid," "who I'm trying to avoid" is a restrict ive clause, since it 's what ident ifies the professor. But in the sent ence "That 's my Hist ory professor, who I'm trying to avoid," the same clause is nonrestrictive, since the professor has already been ident ified as "my Hist ory professor." There should always be a comma before a nonrestrict ive clause, but not before a restrict ive clause.
 
==========constrict (1) To draw t ogether or make narrow. (2) To limit .


?
 She felt that small t owns, where everyone seems to know every move you make and is just wait ing to gossip about it , can constrict your life t erribly.


Art eries constrict ed by cholest erol slow the flow of blood, justas traffic art eries or highways constrict ed  by  accident s  slow  the  flow  of  traffic.  But constriction  isn't  always  physical. Economic growth may be constrict ed by trade barriers. A narrow, constrict ed life may be the result  of povert y or lack of opport unit y. And an actress may feel constrict ed by a role she played as a child or by her TV charact er from years ago, which the public refuses to forget .
 
==========vasoconstrict or
  Something such as a nerve fiber or a drug that narrows a blood vessel.


?
 For operat ions like this, my dent ist likes to use a vasoconstrict or to keep bleeding to a minimum.


Our blood vessels are constant ly narrowing and widening in response to our act ivit y or our environment , constrict ing in order to retain body heatand widening to getrid of excess heat . So when we're hot our skin flushes, and when we're very cold we become pale. Since the width of the blood vessels affect s blood pressure, vasoconstrict ors are prescribed to treat low blood pressure. Vasoconstrict ors include ant ihistamines and amphetamines, as well as nicot ine and caffeine; we commonly buy them for our runny noses and bloodshot eyes as well. The opposit e of vasoconstrict ors are vasodilators, which are commonly used to treathigh blood pressure.

==========STRU/STRUCT comes from the Latin verb struere, meaning "t o put t ogether, build, arrange." A structure is something that 's been constructed,-that is, built or put t ogether. Instructions t ell how the pieces should be arranged. Something that obstructs is a barrier that 's been "built " to stand in your way. And something destructive "unbuilds."
 
==========deconstruct ion
          Analysis  of  t ext s, works  of  art , and  cult ural pat t erns that is int ended to expose the assumpt ions on which they are based, especially by exposing the limitat ions of language.


?
 Deconstruct ion  has  been  performed  on Huckleberry Finn by English professors so many t imes that it 's a wonder there's anything left of it .


Deconstruction doesn'tact ually mean "demolit ion"; inst ead it means "breaking down" or analyzing something (especially the words in a work of fict ion or nonfict ion) to discover it s true significance, which is supposedly almost never exact ly what the author int ended. A feminist may deconstructan old novel to show how even an innocent -seeming st ory somehow depends on the oppression of women. A new west ern may deconstruct the myths of the old Westand show lawmen as vicious and criminals as flawed but decent . Table manners, The Sound of Music, and cosmet ics ads have all been the subject s of deconstructionistanalysis. Of course, not everyone agrees with deconstruct ionist int erpretat ions, and some people reject the whole idea of deconstruct ion, but most of us have run int o it by now even if we didn'trealize it .
 
==========infrastruct ure
      (1) The underlying foundat ion or basic framework. (2) A syst em of public works.


?
 The public loved her speeches about crime but dozed off when she brought up highway repair and infrastruct ure det eriorat ion.


Infra- means "below"; so the infrastruct ure is the "underlying struct ure" of a country and it s economy, the fixed installat ions that it needs in order to funct ion. These include roads, bridges, dams, the wat er and sewer syst ems, railways and subways, airport s, and harbors. These are generally government -builtand publicly owned. Some people also speak about such things as the int ellect ual infrastruct ure or the infrastruct ure of science research, but the meaning of such not ions can be extremely vague.
 
==========construe                        (1) To explain the arrangementand meaning of words in a sent ence.
(2) To understand or explain; int erpret .


?
 She asked how I had construed his last e-mail, and I t old her that something about ithad left me very worried.


Construe can usually be translat ed as "int erpret ." It 's oft en used in law; thus, an At t orney General might construe the t erm "serious injury" in a child-abuse law to include bruises, or a judge might construe language about gift s to "heirs" to include spouses. The IRS's construal of some of your act ivit ies might be different from your own-and much more expensive at tax t ime. Construing is also close to translat ing; so  when  the  Brit ish  say  "public  school,"  for instance, it should be construed or translat ed as "prep school" in American t erms.
 
==========instrumental
(1) Act ing as a means, agent , or t ool. (2) Relat ing to an instrument , especially a musical instrument .


?
 His mother had been instrumental in start ing the new art s program at the school, for which she was honored at the spring ceremony.


A n instrument is a t ool, something used to construct. It 's oft en a t ool for making music. A musical saw happens to be a carpent er's t ool that can be played with a violin bow (though you probably wouldn't want to play a wrench or a pair of pliers). The musical meanings of instrumental, as in "It start s with an instrumental piece" or "a jazz instrumental," are common. But the meanings "helpful," "useful," and "essent ial," as in "He was instrumental in get t ing my book published," are justas common.
 
==========PROP/PROPRI comes from the Latin word proprius, meaning "own." A proprietor is an owner, and property is whathe or she owns. And the original meaning of proper was "belonging to oneself," so a writ er around the year 1400 could say "With his own proper sword he was slain," even if we might not say it quit e the same way t oday.
 
==========proprietary
     (1) Relat ing to an owner or propriet or; made or sold by one who has the sole right to do so. (2) Privat ely owned and run as a profit -making organizat ion.


?
 The local hospital was a not -for-profit inst it ut ion, whereas the nearby nursing homes were proprietary.


A proprietary process is a manufact uring process that others are forbidden to use, and a proprietary trademark is a name that only the owner can use. Legal right s of this kind are ensured by copyright s and pat ent s. Aft er a certain period of t ime, invent ions and processes lose their legal prot ect ion, cease to be proprietary, and ent er the "public domain," meaning that everyone can use them freely. Baseball fans oft en take a proprietary at t it ude t oward their favorit e t eam-that is, they behave more or less as if they own it , even though the only thing they may own is the right to yell from a bleacher seat t ill the end of a game.
 
==========propriet y                   (1)  The  stat e  of  being  proper;  appropriat eness.  (2)  Act ing according to what is socially acceptable, especially in conduct bet ween the sexes.


?
 Propriet y used to forbid a young unmarried man and woman to go almostanywhere withoutan adult .


In an earlier era, when social manners were far more elaborat e than they are t oday, propriety and impropriety were words in constant use. Today we're more likely to use them in other cont ext s. We may talk  about  the  propriet y  of  government  officials'  dealings  with  privat e cit izens, the propriet y of the relat ionship bet ween a lawyer and a judge, or the impropriet y of speaking out of t urn in a meet ing that follows Robert 's rules of order. Relat ions bet ween men and women st ill present  quest ions of propriet y, but  t oday it 's oft en in the workplace rather than in social set t ings. Wherever rules, principles, and standard procedures have been clearly stat ed, propriet y can become an issue. Something improper usually isn'tact ually illegal, but it makes people uncomfortable by giving the impression that something isn't quit e right .
 
==========appropriat e
   (1) To take exclusive possession of, oft en withoutright . (2) To setapart for a part icular purpose or use.


?
 It was one of those insult ing words that somet imes getappropriat ed by a group that it 's meant to insult , which then start s using it proudly and defiant ly.


From it s root s, the verb appropriate would mean basically "make one's own"-that is, "take," or somet imes "grab." Each year the Presidentand Congress creat e a budgetand appropriat e funds for each it em in it , funds which most ly come in the form of taxes from the public. In the House of Representat ives, the powerful Appropriations Commit t ee oft en get s the last word on how much money goes to each program. "Misappropriation of funds," on the other hand, is a nice way of saying "theft ." If someone appropriat ed pieces of your novel, you might take him or her to court ; and if you appropriat ed trade secret s from your former employers, you might be the one sued.
 
==========expropriat e
 (1) To take away the right of possession or ownership. (2) To transfer to oneself.


?
 It was only when the country's new government threat ened to expropriat e the American oil refineries that Congress became alarmed.


In ancientrome, an emperor could condemn a wealthy senat or, have him killed, and expropriat e his propert y. In 1536 Henry V I declared himself head of the new Church of England and expropriat ed the lands and wealth of the Roman Catholic monast eries. And nearly all of North America was expropriat ed from the American Indians, usually withoutany paymentatall. Today, democrat ic government s only carry out  legal expropriations, in which the owners are properly paid for their land-for example, when a highway or other public project needs to be built .

==========TORT comes from a form of the Latin verb torquere, meaning "t o t wist , wind, or wrench." In torture, part s of the body may be wrenched or t wist ed or stret ched; so those "Indian sunburns" that schoolkids give by t wist ing in different direct ions on some unlucky guy's wrist stay pret t y close to torture's original meaning.
 
==========t ort         A wrongful act that does not involve breach of contractand for which the injured part y can receive damages in a civil act ion.


?
 The manufact urer was almost bankrupt ed by the massive t ortact ions brought by employees harmed by asbest os.


Tort came int o English straight from French many cent uries ago, and it st ill looks a lit t le odd. It s root meaning of "t wist ed" (as opposed to "straight ") obviously came to mean "wrong" (as opposed to "right "). Every first -year law st udent  takes a course in the important  subject  of t ort s. Tort s include all the so-called "product -liabilit y" cases, against manufact urers of cars, household product s, children's t oys, and so on. They also cover dog bit es, slander and libel, and a huge variet y of other very personal cases of injury, both mental and physical-Tort s class is never dull. If you're sued for a t ortand lose, you usually have to pay "damages"-that is, a sum of money-t o the person who you wronged.
 
==========ext ort                     To obtain from a person by force, threat s, or illegal power.


?
 She had tried to ext ort money from a film star, claiming thathe was the father of her baby.


To ext ort is lit erally to wrench something out of someone. Extortion is a mainstay of organized crime. Justas the school bully ext ort s lunch money from the smaller kids in exchange for not beat ing them up, thugs ext ort "prot ect ion" money from business owners with threat s of violence. But that 's only one kind of ext ort ion; a mobst er might ext ort favors from a polit ician with threat s of revealing some dark secret , justas you might ext orta favor from a brother or sist er by promising not to t ell on them.
 
==========cont ort                       To t wist in a violent manner.


?
 The governor's explanat ion of his affair was so cont ort ed that it only made mat t ers worse for him.


Circus contortionists are known for t wist ing their bodies int o pret zels; such contortions t end to be easier for females than for males, and much easier for the young than for the old. When trying to say something uncomfortable or  dishonest ,  people  oft en  go  through  verbal cont ort ions. But when someone else "t wist s" something you said or did, we usually say inst ead that they've distorted it .
 
==========t ort uous
     (1) Having many t wist s, bends, or t urns; winding. (2) Crooked or tricky; involved, complex.


?
 The road over the mountains was long and dangerously t ort uous, and as you rounded the sharp corners you could never see whether a huge truck might be barreling down t oward you.


A labyrinth is a t ort uous maze. The first labyrinth was builtas a prison for the monstrous Minotaur, half bull and half man; only by holding one end of a thread was the heroic Theseus able to ent er and slay the Minotaur and then exit . A t ort uous problem, a t ort uous hist ory, and  the t ort uous path of a bill through Congress all have many unexpect ed t wist s and t urns; a t ort uous explanat ion or argument may be t oo crooked for it s own good. Don't confuse tortuous with torturous, which means "t ort ured" or "painfully unpleasant "; tortuous has nothing to do with t ort ure.
 
==========VIV comes from vivere, the Latin verb meaning "t o live or be alive." A survivor has lived through something t errible. A revival brings something back to life, whether it 's an old film, int erest in a long-dead novelist , or religious enthusiasm in a group, maybe in a huge t ent in the countryside.
 
==========vivacious
Lively in an at tract ive way.


?
 For the cheerleading squad, only the most out going, energet ic, and vivacious of the st udent s get chosen.


Vivacious can be used to describe a piece of music or writ ing, but it 's generally used t oday to describe people, and part icularly women. The main female charact ers in Shakespeare's plays- Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing , Rosalind in As You Like It, and Port ia in The Merchant of Venice, for example-are oft en full of humor, spirit , and vivacity.
 
==========bon vivant
      A sociable person with a love of excellent food and drink.


?
 My uncle and aunt were bons vivant s, and could usually be found in the evening ata swank midt own bar surrounded by a crowd of t ipsy merrymakers.


Bon vivant comes straight from French, where it means lit erally "good liver," and is st ill pronounced in the French way, though we've act ually been using it in English since the 17th cent ury. A proper bon vivanthas some money and lot s of friends and plent y of st yle and knows a good wine and can t ell a great st ory and loves to laugh. Because of all these requirement s, true bons vivant s are rather rare-but that doesn't mean there aren't plent y of people who hope to be one someday.
 
==========revivify                           To give new life t o; bring back to life.


?
 All their effort s to revivify the boys' club seemed to be get t ing them nowhere, t ill one of the board members had a great idea.


Worn-out soil may be revivified by careful organic t ending. A t errific new recruit can revivify a discouraged foot ball t eam, and an imaginat ive and energet ic new principal can revivify a failing high school. Aft er World War I, one European country aft er another was slowly revivified, their economies and cult ural life gradually coming back to life. Not ice thatrevivify looks like some other words with very similar meanings, such as revive, revitalize, and reinvigorate.
 
==========vivisect ion
 Operat ion  on  living  animals,  oft en  for  experimental purposes.


?
 The lab at t empt s to avoid vivisect ion in it s research, concentrat ing inst ead on alt ernat ive methods thathave been developed.


Vivisection includes the Latin root sect, meaning "cut ." The Greek physician Galen, who lived during the 2nd cent ury A.D., pract iced vivisect ion on live monkeys and dogs to learn such things as the role of the spinal cord in muscle act ivit y and whether veins and art eries carry air or blood; his findings formed the basis of medical pract ice for more than a thousand years. Vivisect ion cont inues to be used in drug and medical research t oday, but oft en in secret , since it makes most people very uncomfortable and some groups are violent ly opposed to it .

==========SERV means "t o be subject t o." A servant is the person who serves you with meals and provides other necessary services. A t ennis or volleyball serve put s the ball in play, much as a servant put s food on the table.
 
==========serviceable
(1) Helpful or useful. (2) Usable.


?
 In the at t ic they found some chairs and a table, which, with a new coat of paint , became quit e serviceable for informal get -t ogethers.


Someone who speaks serviceable Spanish isn't fluent in it but get s by pret t y well. A serviceable jacket is pract ical and maybe even rugged. But serviceable somet imes damns with faint praise. A serviceable performance is all right but not inspired. Serviceable curtains aren't  the ideal color or pat t ern, but they serve their purpose. A serviceable pair of shoes is st urdy but won't win you any fashion point s.
 
==========servile                    (1) Suitable to a servant . (2) Humbly submissive.


?
 The dog's manner was servile, and it lacked a healthy independence.


During the Middle Ages, most of the farming was done by a servile class known as serfs, who enjoyed hardly any personal freedom. This began to change in the 14th cent ury; but the Russian serfs weren't freed unt il the 1860s, when the servile class in the U.S. was also freed. But servile t oday usually refers to a personal manner; a person who shows servility usually isn'ta servant, but simply seems t oo eager to please and seems to lack self-respect .
 
==========servit ude
  A stat e or condit ion of slavery or bondage to another.


?
 She spentan ent ire summer working ata resort under condit ions that felt like ut t er servit ude.


Servit ude is slavery or anything resembling it . The ent ire black populat ion of colonial America lived in permanent servit ude. And millions of the whit es who populat ed this country arrived in "indent ured servit ude," obliged to pay off the cost of their journey with several years of labor. Servit ude comes in many forms, of course: in the bad old days of the Brit ish navy, it was said that the difference bet ween going to sea and going to jail was that you were less likely to drown in jail.
 
==========subservient                           (1) Serving or useful in an inferior sit uat ion or capacit y. (2) Slavishly obedient .


?
 Many have wondered why Congress always seems subservient to the financial industry, support ing it even when the vot ers are angrily calling for reforms.


Since sub- means "below," it emphasizes the lower posit ion of the person in the subservient one. Soldiers of a given rank are always subservient to those of a higher rank; this subservience is symbolized by the requirement that they salut e  their  superior  at  every opport unit y. Women have oft en been forced int o subservientrelat ionships with men. A small nat ion may feel subservient to it s more powerful neighbor, obliged to obey even when it doesn't want t o. So subservience usually brings with ita good dose of resent ment .
 
==========CLUS comes from the Latin claudere, "t o close." Words based on the Latin verb oft en have forms in which the d becomes an s. So, for example, include, which once meant "t o shut up or enclose" and now means "t o contain," has the relat ed word inclusive, which means "including everything."
 
==========occlusion
 An obstruct ion or blockage; the act of obstruct ing or closing off.


?
 The doct ors worry thata loosened piece of plaque from the art ery wall could lead to an occlusion of a brain art ery, result ing in a stroke.


Occlusion, formed with the prefix ob-, here meaning "in the way," occurs when something has been closed up or blocked off. Almostall heartat tacks are the result of the occlusion of a coronary (heart ) art ery by a blood clot , and many strokes are caused by an occlusion in an art ery serving the brain. When a person's upper and lower t eeth form a malocclusion, they close incorrect ly or badly. An occlusion, or occluded front , happens when a fast -moving cold front overtakes a slow-moving warm frontand slides underneath it , lift ing the warm air and blocking it s movement .
 
==========exclusive
 (1) Not  shared; available to only one person or group, especially those from a high social class. (2) Full and complet e.


?
 That t echnology is exclusive to one cell-phone manufact urer, but some of the others are dying to use it .


In words such as expel, export, and exclusive, the prefix ex- means "out of, out side." Thus, to exclude means basically to close the door in order to keep someone or something out . When the word appears in an advert isement , it 's oft en making an appeal to snobs. An "exclusive" offer is supposedly made to only a few people; not so many years ago, "exclusive" housing development s excluded those of a certain race or color. If a product is being sold exclusively by one st ore, you won't be able to find itanywhere else. When a newspaper or news show has an exclusive, it 's a st ory that no one else has yetreport ed. Exclusive's ant onym is inclusive; an inclusive policy, an inclusive church, or an inclusive approach is one that  aims to include as many people as possible.
 
==========recluse                      A person who lives withdrawn from societ y.


?
 The lonely farmhouse was home to a middle-aged recluse, a st ooped, bearded man who would never answer the door when someone knocked.


Greta Garbo and Howard Hughes were two of the most famously reclusive celebrit ies of modern t imes. She had been a great int ernat ional star, called the most beaut iful woman in the world; he had been an  aircraft  manufact urer and  film producer, with  one  of  the  great est fort unes in the world. It seems that Garbo's reclusiveness result ed from her desire to leave her public with only the youthful image of her face. Hughes was t errified of germs, though that was the least of his problems.
 
==========seclusion                    (1) A screening or hiding from view. (2) A place that is isolat ed or hidden.


?
 The police immediat ely placed him in seclusion in a hospital room, with armed guards at the door.


With it s prefix se-, "apart ," seclusion has the basic meaning of a place or condit ion that 's "closed away." A lone island may be secluded, and it s seclusion might be what it s owner prizes mostabout it . President s and their staffs may go int o seclusion before making crit ical decisions. Monast ery life is purposely secluded, and monks may have taken vows to live lives of seclusion. The deadly brown recluse spider prefers seclusion but is somet imes dist urbed by very unlucky people.

==========Greek and Latin Borrowings

acme                   Highest point ; summit , peak.


?
 Last Sat urday's upset vict ory over Michigan may prove to have been the acme of the ent ire season.


In Greek, acme meanta mountain peak, but in English we hardly ever use it in the physical sense. Inst ead we speak of someone's new job as the acme of her career, or of a certain leap as the acme of classical dance t echnique. In old Road Runner cart oons, the Acme Company is the provider of every ingenious device imaginable. But the word can'talways be taken quit e lit erally as a brand or company name; it 's possible, for instance, that something called the Acme Bar & Grill may not be the absolut ely highestand best example of a bar and grill. And don't confuse acme with acne, the skin disorder-even though both act ually come from the same word.
 
==========catharsis
   A cleansing or purificat ion of the body, emot ions, or spirit .


?
 Having broken down sobbing at the funeral, he said aft erwards that ithad felt like a catharsis.


One of the earliest uses of catharsis is in Arist ot le's Poetics, where the philosopher claims that wat ching a tragedy provides the spectat ors with a desirable catharsis because of the buildup and release of the emot ions of pit y and fear. Sigmund Freud borrowed the t erm as a name for the process of bringing a set of unconscious desires and ideas back int o consciousness in order to eliminat e their bad effect s. Today some people claim it 's cathartic to merely express your anger or grief, since it "get s it out of your syst em." Laxat ives are also called cathart ic, since they provide a physical catharsis that some people believe to be healthful. But there's no general agreementaboutany of this, and the not ion of catharsis remains a very personal one.
 
==========colossus                          (1) A gigant ic stat ue. (2) A person or thing thatresembles such a stat ue in size or act ivit y or influence.


?
 Even if Citizen Kane had been his only movie, Orson Welles would be regarded as a colossus in the hist ory of film.


The original colossi (not ice the plural form) were the larger-than-life stat ues made by the Greeks and Romans. The most famous of these was the Colossus of Rhodes, a stat ue of the sun god Helios built on the Greek island of Rhodes around 280 B.C. that was over 100 feet tall and t ook more than 12 years to build. The Stat ue of Libert y is a modern colossus, enormous and stat ely, at the entrance to New York Harbor. And someone who has played a colossal role in hist ory, such as Winst on Churchill, may be called a colossus as well.
 
==========detrit us                        Loose mat erial thatresult s from disint egrat ion; debris.


?
 The base of the cliff was lit t ered with the detrit us of cent uries of erosion.


Aft er the firsthard freeze of fall, gardens are sadly lit t ered with the detrit us of the summer's plant s and produce: stalks, leaves, vines, rot t ed vegetables, and maybe even a hand trowel left behind. As the flooding Mississippi River retreat s back to it s ordinary course, it leaves detrit us behind in it s wake, debris gathered from everywhere by the raging wat ers. The detrit us of civilizat ion may include junkyards and abandoned buildings; mental detrit us may includes all kinds of useless trivia. Not ice how this word is pronounced; for some reason, people oft en try to accent the first syllable rather than the second.
 
==========hoi polloi                           The general populat ion; the masses.


?
 He's a t errible snob, the kind of person who thinks it 's funny to say things like "the riffraff" and "the hoi polloi" and "the great unwashed."


In Greek, hoi polloi means simply "the many." (Even though hoi it self means "the," in English we almostalways say "the hoi polloi.") It comes originally from the famous Funeral Orat ion by Pericles, where it was act ually used in a posit ive way. Today it 's generally used by people who  think of themselves as superior-though it 's also somet imes used in Pericles' democrat ic spirit . By the way, ithas no relat ion to hoity-toity, meaning "st uck-up," which start s with the same sound buthas nothing to do with Greek.
 
==========kudos                      (1) Fame and renown thatresult from an achievement ; prest ige. (2) Praise.


?
 His first film earned him kudos at the independent film fest ivals, and the big st udios were soon calling him up.


Kudos is an odd word in English. In Greek, kydos meant "glory" or "prest ige"; in other words, it wasn't something you could count . But in English kudos looks like a plural and is therefore oft en treat ed as one. So people now somet imes use the form kudo, with kudos as it s plural.
 
==========onus                  A disagreeable necessit y or obligat ion; responsibilit y.


?
 Now that Congress has passed the bill, the onus is on the President to live up to his promise and sign it int o law.


In Latin onus means lit erally a "burden," like a part icularly heavy backpack. But in English an onus is more oft en a burden of responsibilit y or blame. In legal language, the onus probandi is the "burden of proof," meaning the big job of assembling enough evidence to prove a person's guilt , since the accused is innocent unt il proved guilt y.
 
==========st igma                      A mark of shame: stain.


?
 In these small villages, the st igma of pregnancy is a t errible thing for an unmarried girl.


In Greek and Latin, a st igma was a mark or brand, especially one that marked a slave, so a st igma marked a person as inferior. When the plural form stigmata is used, it usually refers to the nail wounds on Christ 's hands and feet , wounds which have somet imes reappeared on the hands or feet of lat er worshippers such as St . Francis. When stigma began to be used in English, it usually meant the kind of mark or stain you can'tact ually see. So t oday we hear about the st igma of homelessness, the st igma of overweight , and the st igma of mental illness. People may be so afraid of being stigmatized for losing a job that they'll put on their office clothes and drive out their driveways every weekday morning so that the neighbors won't know.

TEXT comes from a Latin verb that means "t o weave." So a textile is a woven or knit t ed cloth. The mat erial it 's made from det ermines it s texture, the smoothness or roughness of it s surface. And individual words are "woven" int o sent ences and paragraphs to form a text.
 
==========t ext ual
     Having to do with or based on a t ext .


?
 A t ext ual analysis of 1,700 lipst ick names, including Hot Mama and Raisin Hell, suggest ed to the author that the women buying them lack a healthy sense of self-worth.


Before the invent ion of the print ing press, books were produced by hand. When the text of a book is copied this way, t ext ual errors can creep in, and a t ext that 's been copied again and again can contain many such errors. By comparing different copies of a work, t ext ual crit ics try to figure out where the copyist s went wrong and rest ore the t ext to it s original form so that modern readers can again enjoy the correct versions of ancient t ext s. When a class performs t ext ual analysis of a poem, however, they are looking closely at it s individual words and phrases in an effort to det ermine the poem's meanings.
 
==========cont ext                    (1) The surrounding spoken or writ t en mat erial in which a word or remark occurs. (2) The condit ions or circumstances in which an event occurs; environment or set t ing.


?
 The governor claimed thathis remarks were taken out of cont extand thatanyone looking at the whole speech would geta different impression.


Cont extreveals meaning. The cont ext of an unfamiliar word can give us contextual clues to help us det ermine what the word means. Taking a remark out of cont ext can change it s meaning ent irely. Likewise, people's act ions somet imes have to be underst ood as having occurred in a part icular cont ext . The behavior of hist orical figures  should  be  seen  in  the cont ext of their t ime, when standards may have been very different from our own.
 
==========hypert ext                        A database format  in which informat ion relat ed to that  on a display screen can be accessed direct ly from the screen (as by a mouse click).


?
 Three days ago my mother was asking me why some of the words are underlined in blue, but by yest erday she was already an expert in hypert ext .


Since hyper- generally means "above, beyond" (see HYPER), hypert ext is something that 's gone beyond the limitat ions of ordinary t ext . Thus, unlike the t ext in a book, hypert ext permit s you, by clicking with a mouse, to immediat ely  access  t ext  in  one  of  millions  of  different electronic sources. Hypert ext is now so familiar that most comput er users may not even know the word, which was coined by Ted Nelson back in the early 1960s. It t ook a few more years for hypert ext to act ually be creat ed, by Douglas Engelbart , and then quit e a few more years before the introduct ion of the World Wide Web in 1991.
 
==========subt ext
The underlying meaning of a spoken or writ t en passage.


?
 The t ough and cynical t one of the st ory is contradict ed by it s romant ic subt ext .


A lit erary t ext oft en has more than one meaning: the lit eral meaning of the words on the page, and their hidden meaning, what exist s "bet ween the lines"-the subt ext . Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, for example, is about the Salem wit chcraft trials of the 17th cent ury, but it s subt ext is the comparison of those trials with the "wit ch hunt s" of the 1950s, when many people were unfairly accused of being communist s. Even a social conversat ion bet ween a man and a woman may have a subt ext , but you may have to list en very closely to figure out what it is. Don't  confuse subtext with subplot, a less important plot that moves along in parallel with the main plot .
 
==========PLAC comes from the Latin placere, "t o please or be agreeable t o," or placare, "t o soothe or calm." Pleasant, pleasurable, and pleasing all derive from this root , even though their spelling makes ithard to see.
 
==========placat e                      To calm the anger or bit t erness of someone.


?
 The Romans had a number of ways of placat ing the gods, which occasionally included burying slaves alive.


Polit icians are constant ly having to placat e angry vot ers. Diplomat s frequent ly need to placat e a country's allies or possible enemies. Parent s are always placat ing kids who think they've been unfairly denied something. And lovers and spouses are some of the champion placat ers. It 's no secret that people with the best social skills are oft en the bestat placat ing other people
-and that they themselves may be the ones who benefit the most by it .
 
==========placebo                  A  harmless  substance  given to a  pat ient  in  place  of  genuine medicat ion, either for experimental purposes or to soothe the pat ient .


?
 The placebo worked miraculously: his skin rash cleared up, his sleep improved, and he even ceased to hear voices.


Doct ors doing research on new treat ment s for disease oft en give one group a placebo while a second group takes the new medicat ion. Since those in the placebo group usually believe they're get t ing the real thing, their own hopeful at t it ude may bring about improvement in their condit ion. Thus, for the real drug to be considered effect ive, it must produce even bet t er result s than the placebo. Placebos have another use as well. A doct or who suspect s thata pat ient 's physical sympt oms are psychologically produced may prescribe a placebo in the hope that mentally produced sympt oms can also be mentally cured.
 
==========placidit y Serene freedom from int errupt ion or dist urbance; calmness.


?
 Her placidit y seemed eerie in view of the destruct ion she had wit nessed and the huge loss she had suffered.


A placid  lake  has  a  smooth  surface  unt ouched  by  wind. A placid  scene  is  one  in  which everything seems calm; it may even include a meadow with a few placid cows grazing on it . Someone with a placid personalit y has an inner peacefulness that isn't easily dist urbed. As a personalit y  trait , placidity is surely a lot  bet t er than some of the alt ernat ives; however, the word somet imes describes people who are also a bit passive, like those cont ent ed cows.
 
==========implacable
      Not capable of being pleased, sat isfied, or changed.


?
 At t empt s to negot iat e a peace set t lement bet ween such implacable enemies seem doomed to failure.


Implacable, with it s negat ive prefix im-, describes something or someone that can't be calmed or soothed or alt ered. A person who carries a grudge feels an implacable resent ment -a resent ment that can't be soothed. An implacable foe is one you can't negot iat e with, perhaps one who's fueled by implacable hatred. And implacable somet imes describes things that only seem to be alive: an implacable st orm is one that seems as if it will never let up, and an implacable fat e is one that you can't outrun or hide from.

==========AUT/AUTO comes from the Greek word for "same" or "self." Something automatic operat es by it self, and an automobile moves by it self, without the help of a horse. An autograph is in the handwrit ing of the person him- or herself, and an autopsy is an inspect ion of a corpse by an examiner's own eyes.
 
==========aut omat on                           (1) An aut omat ic machine, especially a robot . (2) An individual who act s mechanically.


?
 The work he used to do as a welder in the assembly planthas been taken over by a sophist icat ed aut omat on designed overseas.


The idea of the aut omat on has fascinat ed people for many cent uries. A traveler to the emperor's court in Byzant ium in A.D. 949 report ed that mechanical birds sat in a golden tree singing the songs of their species; that  mechanical lions  flanked  the  throne, roaring  and swit ching their great tails; and that , as he st ood wat ching, the emperor's throne suddenly shot upward t oward the high ceiling, and when it slowly descended the emperor was wearing new robes. Early aut omata (not ice the common plural form) oft en relied on wat er, st eam, or falling weight s to power them. Today aut omata, oft en called robot s, are used in manufact uring plant s to build not only vehicles butalso much smaller electronic equipment .
 
==========aut oimmune                          Of, relat ing t o, or caused by ant ibodies thatat tack molecules, cells, or t issues of the organism producing them.


?
 His doct ors suspect ed that the strange combinat ion of sympt oms might be those of an aut oimmune disease.


Any healthy body produces a variet y of ant ibodies, prot eins in the blood whose job is to prot ect the body from unwant ed bact eria, viruses, and cancer cells. The cells and organs that deal with such infect ions make up the immune syst em. In some people and animals, for various reasons, the ant ibodies become overact ive and t urn on the body's healthy t issues as well; the result is an aut oimmune disease-an immune response direct ed against one's own self. More than eight y aut oimmune diseases have been ident ified, the best -known being t ype 1 diabet es, mult iple sclerosis, lupus, and rheumat oid arthrit is.
 
==========aut onomy                   (1) The  power or right  of  self-government . (2) Self-direct ing freedom, especially moral independence.


?
 Though normally respect ful of their son's aut onomy, the Slocums drew the line athis request to take a cross-country mot orcycle trip.


Since nomos is Greek for "law," something autonomous makes it s own laws. The amount of aut onomy enjoyed by French-speaking Quebec, or of Palest inians in certain t owns in Israel, or of independent -minded regions of Russia, have become major issues. The aut onomy of individual stat es in the Unit ed Stat es has posed serious const it ut ional quest ions for two cent uries. The aut onomy of children is almostalways limit ed by their parent s. But when those parent s are elderly and begin driving poorly and get t ing confused about their finances, their children may see the need to limit their aut onomy in much the same way.
 
==========aut ism                \  A condit ion that begins in childhood and causes problems in forming social relat ionships and in communicat ing with others and includes behavior in which certain act ivit ies are constant ly repeat ed.


?
 She was beginning to think thather four-year-old's strange behavior and complet e lack of int erest in his playmat es might be due to aut ism.


Aut ism, in it s strict sense, becomes evident before the age of 3. The aut ist ic child generally refuses to talk, becomes obsessive about t oys,  resist s  any  change  vehement ly,  and somet imes flies int o unexplained rages. Aut ism is believed to be biological in origin, and seems to be relat ed to several milder condit ions such as Asperger's syndrome. As many as 1 in 100 children, most ly boys, may have aut ism, Asperger's, or a relat ed condit ion. About one in t en aut ist ic children t urns out to have a remarkable mental gift , such as the abilit y to play a difficult piece on the piano aft er a single hearing or repair a complex machine without  any training. Many autistic children seem to grow out of itas they become adult s, and some aut ist ic adult s manage to live independent ly. Autistic is somet imes used loosely to describe a much more common kind of psychological withdrawal in adult s.
 
==========GRAT comes from the Latin words gratus, meaning "pleasing, welcome, or agreeable," and gratia, meaning "grace, agreeableness, or pleasant ness." A meal that 's served graciously will be received with gratitude by grateful guest s; those who show no appreciat ion could be called ingrates.
 
==========grat ify                       (1)  To  be  a  source  of  pleasure  or  sat isfact ion;  give  pleasure  or sat isfact ion t o. (2) To give in t o; indulge or sat isfy.


?
 It grat ified him immensely to see his daught er bloom so beaut ifully in high school.


A gratifying experience is quiet ly pleasing or sat isfying. But grat ifying an impulse means giving in to it , which isn'talways such a good idea, and "instant gratification" of every desire will result in a life based on junk food and worse. Truly grat ifying experiences and accomplishment s usually are the result of t ime and effort .
 
==========grat uit y
 Something, especially a t ip, given freely.


?
 Aft er sit t ing for three hours over a six-course meal at Le Passage, we always leave the wait er a very generous grat uit y.


Gratuity is a fancier and more formal word than tip. It occurs most oft en in writ t en not ices along the lines of "Grat uit ies accept ed." It s formalit y makes it best suit ed for describing t ips of the dignified, expensive variet y. For the taxi driver who takes you to the superb Belgian restaurant , it 's a t ip; for the restaurant 's maitre d', it 's a grat uit y.
 
==========grat uit ous
   Not called for by the circumstances.


?
 Members of the commit t ee were object ing to what they considered grat uit ous violence on t elevision.


In it s original sense, gratuitous can refer to anything given freely, like a t ip. But the word now almostalways applies to something that 's seen as not only unnecessary (like a t ip, which you don'treally have to give) butalso unwelcome. To insult or crit icize someone gratuitously is to make a hurt ful remark that 's uncalled for and undeserved. But scenes in a film that you yourself might call grat uit ous were, unfort unat ely, probably put there to at tractan audience that want s to see them.
 
==========ingrat iat e
To gain favor or acceptance by making a deliberat e effort .


?
 None of her at t empt s to ingrat iat e herself with the professor seemed to improve her grades.


To ingrat iat e yourself is to put yourself in someone's good graces-that is, to gain someone's approval. People oft en try to ingrat iat e themselves by engaging in an act ivit y known by such names as bootlicking, apple-polishing, and brownnosing. But some people are able to win favor just by relying on their ingratiating smiles.

==========CLAM/CLAIM comes from the Latin verb clamare, meaning "t o shout  or cry out ." To claim
oft en means "t o call for." And an exclamation is a cry of shock, joy, or surprise.
 
==========clamor           (1) Noisy shout ing; loud, cont inuous noise. (2) Strong and act ive prot est or demand.


?
 The clamor in the hallways bet ween classes was part icularly loud that morning as news of the stat e championship swept through the st udent body.


The clamor on Broadway at midday can be ast onishing to a t ourist from a midwest ern t own; if they happen to be digging up the street with jackhammers, the clamor can be even worse. The clamor on the floor of a st ock exchange goes on without st opping for seven hours every day. A clamor of prot est may somet imes be quiet er, but is oft en justas hard to ignore. A polit ican who receives a thousand e-mails a day clamoring for his resignat ion mightas well be list ening to an angry crowd.
 
==========acclamat ion                          (1)  A  loud,  eager  indicat ion  of  approval,  praise,  or agreement . (2) An overwhelming yes vot e by cheers, shout s, or applause.


?
 To the principal's suggest ion that Friday be a holiday to honor the vict ors in the nat ional math olympics, the st udent s yelled their approval in a long and loud acclamat ion.


Approval can come from a single person, butacclamat ion requires a larger audience. An acclaimed movie is widely praised, and crit ical acclaim can lead to box-office success. When a popular proposal comes up in a legislat ure, the speaker may ask that it be passed "by acclamat ion," which means that everyone just get s to yell and cheer in approval and no one bothers count ing the vot es atall.
 
==========declaim                      To speak in the formal manner of someone delivering a speech.


?
 Almostany opinion can sound convincing if it 's declaimed loudly and with convict ion.


Declaiming suggest s an unnat ural st yle of speech best suit ed to a stage or podium. List ening to an act or declaim a passage in a Shakespeare play can be enjoyable. List ening to Aunt Ida at Sunday dinner declaiming on the virt ues of roughage might not be. Most people don'tappreciat e being treat ed as an audience, and good advice is usually more welcome when it 's not given in a declamatory st yle.
 
==========proclaim                         To declare or announce publicly, officially, or definit ely.


?
 He burst int o the dorm room, jumped ont o his bed, and proclaimed thathe had justaced the sociology exam.


Th e pro- in proclaim  means  "forward, out ,"  so  a proclamation  is  an  "out ward"  stat ement int ended for the public. We oft en think of proclamat ions as something issued by monarchs or dictat ors, but Lincoln was able to issue his Emancipat ion Proclamat ion because as presidenthe had the power to free the slaves in certain areas. Ata slight ly lower level, a governor may proclaim a day in honor of the stat e's firemen, a movie crit ic may proclaim a direct or to be the best of all, or you may proclaim your New Year's resolut ions to a crowd of friends.
 
==========CRAC/CRAT comes from the Greek word meaning "power." At tached to another root , it indicat es which group holds the power. With demos, the Greek word for "people," it forms democracy, a form of government in which the people rule. A theocracy, from the Greek theos, "god," is government based on divine guidance. In a meritocracy, people earn power by their own merit .
 
==========arist ocrat
 The highest social class in a country, usually because of birth and wealth.


?
 A wealthy arist ocrat from a famous European family, she surprised everyone by becoming a support er of lit t le-known jazz musicians.


Since aristos means "best " in Greek, ancient Greeks such as Plat o and Arist ot le used the word aristocracy to mean a syst em of rule by the best people-that is, those who deserved to rule because of their int elligence and moral excellence. But this kind of  "best "  soon  became something you could inherit from your parent s. The Unit ed Stat es has no formal arist ocracy- no noble t it les such as baron or marquis that stay in the family-but certain American families have achieved an almostaristocratic stat us because  of the wealth they've  held ont o for generat ions.
 
==========aut ocrat ic                        (1) Having to do with a form of government in which one person rules. (2) Resembling the ruler of such a government .


?
 It 's hard to believe thata guy who seems so nice to his friends is an aut ocrat ic boss who somet imes fires people just because he's in a bad mood.


Autos in Greek means "same" or "self," so in an aut ocrat ic governmentall the power is held by the leader him- or herself. Aut ocrat ic government s are oft en called dictat orships, or somet imes autocracies. In everyday life, a t eacher, a  parent , or a  foot ball coach  can  all behave  like aut ocrat s as well.
 
==========bureaucrat                 (1) An  appoint ed  government  official. (2) An  official  of  a government or syst em that is marked by fixed and complex rules that oft en result in long delays.


?
 To set t le his insurance claim he had to make his way through four or five bureaucrat s, every one of them with a new form to fill out .


In French, a bureau is a desk, so bureaucracy means basically "government by people at desks." Despit e the bad-mouthing they oft en get , part ly because they usually have to st ick so close to the rules, bureaucrat s do almostall the day-t o-day work that keeps a governmentrunning. The idea of a bureaucracy is to split up the complicat ed task of governing a large country int o smaller jobs  that  can  be  handled  by  specialist s. Bureaucratic  government  is nothing new; the Roman empire had an enormous and complex bureaucracy, with the bureaucrat s at lower levels report ing to bureaucrat s above them, and so on up to the emperor himself.
 
==========plut ocracy
(1) Government  by the wealthy. (2) A controlling class of wealthy people.


?
 Theodore Roosevelt sought to limit the power held by the plut ocracy of wealthy industrialist s.


Ploutos was Greek for "wealth," and Plout on, or Plut o, was one of the names used for the Greek god of the underworld, where all the earth's mineral wealth was st ored. So a plut ocracy governs or wields power through it s money. The economic growth in the U.S. in the lat e 19th cent ury  produced a group of enormously  wealthy plutocrats. Huge companies like John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil gained serious polit ical power, and Rockefeller was able to influence lawmakers in stat es where his businesses operat ed. For this reason, it was said in 1905 that Ohio and New Jersey were plut ocracies, not democracies.

 The company had become much more punct ual under the new president , and every meet ing start ed precisely on t ime.


The original meaning of punctual described a puncture made by a surgeon. The word has meant lot s of other things through the cent uries, usually involving being precise about small point s. And t oday punctuality is all about t ime; a punct ual train or a punct ual payment or a punct ual person shows up "on the dot ."
 
==========compunct ion
     (1) Anxiet y caused by guilt . (2) A slight misgiving.


?
 Speeding is something many people seem to do without compunct ion, their only concern being whether they'll get caught .


Compunction is most oft en used in describing people who don't feel it -that  is, who aren't "st ung" or "pricked" by conscience. Ruthless businessmen st eal client s and contract s from other businessmen without compunct ion, and hardened criminals have no compunct ions aboutarmed robbery and worse. Not ice how compunct ion can be used in a noncountable way, like guilt ("He killed without compunct ion"), or in the plural, like qualm ("She had no compunct ions about lying"). But words like guilt, qualm, regret, remorse, doubt, and unease, unlike compunction, are oft en used when talking about people who act ually suffer from them.
 
==========acupunct ure
      A  method  of  relieving  pain  or  curing  illness  by insert ing fine needles through the skin at specific point s.


?
 As a lastresorthe agreed to try acupunct ure treat ment with Dr. Lu, and his pain vanished like magic.


In Latin, acus means "needle," and the English word acupuncture was coined way back in the 17th cent ury to describe a t echnique the Chinese had already been using for 2,000 years. An acupuncturist may insert many extremely fine needles ata t ime; the treat ment is usually uncomfortable but not truly painful. In China t oday, even major surgery is oft en carried out using only acupunct ure to kill the pain; it 's also used for many other condit ions, including insomnia, depression, smoking, and overweight . Acupunct ure is based on ancient theories of bodily energy that  few West ern doct ors have ever accept ed; but even though at t empt s to explain it s effect s by West ern science have been unsuccessful, it 's now widely recognized by doct ors as effect ive for pain reduct ion.
 
==========POT comes from the Latin adject ive potens, meaning "able." Our English word potent means "powerful" or "effect ive," whether for good or bad. A pot ent new ant ibiot ic might be able to deal with infect ions thathave developed resistance to older drugs; an industrial gas might be ident ified as a pot ent contribut or to climat e change; and a pot ent  drink might  leave you staggering.
 
==========pot ent ial                       (1) The possibilit y that something will happen in the fut ure. (2) A cause for hope.


?
 If the plan works we'll be millionaires, but the pot ent ial for disast er is high.


Pot ent ial can be either good or bad. St udying hard increases the pot ent ial for success, but wetroads increase the pot ent ial for accident s. But when a person or thing "has pot ent ial," we always expect something good from it in the fut ure. As an adject ive (as in "pot ent ial losses," "pot ent ial benefit s," et c.), potential usually means simply "possible." In science, however, the adject ive has a special meaning: Potential energy is the kind of st ored energy thata boulder sit t ing at the t op of a cliff has (the opposit e of kinetic energy, which is what ithas as itrolls down that cliff).
 
==========impot ent Lacking power or strength.


?
 The  government  now  knows  it 's  ut t erly  impot ent to st op  the  violence  raging  in  the countryside, and has basically retreat ed to the capital cit y.


A police depart ment may be impot ent to st op the flow of drugs int o a neighborhood. A group of countries may be impot ent to force another country to change it s human-right s policies. The impotence of a prime minist er may be shown by her inabilit y to getan important piece of legislat ion passed. Impotentand impotence may also have a special meaning, when they refer to a man's inabilit y to have sexual int ercourse.
 
==========plenipot ent iary
          A  person, such  as  a  diplomat , who  has complet e power to do business for a government .


?
 In the Greathall, in the presence of the Empress, the plenipot ent iaries of four European nat ions put their signat ures on the treaty.


Back in the 12th cent ury, when the Roman Catholic Church in some ways resembled the powerful Roman empire thathad come before it , the Church revived the Roman concept of an official with plena potens-"full powers"-t o negot iat e agreement s (see PLE/PLEN). Whereas an ambassador could only make offers thata faraway ruler had specified, oft en weeks or months earlier, a plenipot ent iary could negot iat e an ent ire agreement without checking back constant ly with his ruler. Today, with instant electronic communicat ions, this dist inct ion has generally lost it s importance, but  there are st ill ambassadors who wouldn't  be allowed at  a negot iat ing table.
 
==========pot entat e
A powerful ruler.


?
 Aft er 18 years as president of the college, he wielded power like a medieval pot entat e, and no one on the facult y or staff dared to challenge him.


Like such t it les as grand vizier, caliph, and khan, potentate summons up thought s of absolut e rulers of an earlier age in such lands as Turkey, Persia, and India. It oft en suggest s a person who uses power or authorit y in a cruel and unjust way-that is, a t yrant . Today, though it 's st ill used as a t it le by the organizat ion called the Shriners, it 's more oft en used humorously ("Supreme Int ergalact ic Pot entat e," "Pot entat e of Pasta," et c.).

==========Greek and Latin Borrowings

ambrosia
  (1) The food of  the  Greek and Roman gods. (2) Something extremely pleasant to tast e or smell.


?
 Aft er two days lost in the woods, the simple st ew tast ed like ambrosia to them.


Ambrosia lit erally means "immortalit y" in Greek, and in Greek and Roman mythology only the immortals-the gods and goddesses-could eatambrosia or drink nectar. Both may have been divine forms of honey. The gods also used nectar and  ambrosia  like  oils  for  ceremonial anoint ing, and a mixt ure of wat er, oil, and fruit s called ambrosia came to be used in human ceremonies as well. Since we can't know what the mythical ambrosia tast ed or smelled like, we mere mortals are free to give the name to our favorit e ambrosial dessert -perhaps one involving oranges, coconut , and heavy cream.
 
==========dogma              (1)  Something  treat ed  as  established  and  accept ed  opinion. (2) A principle or set of principles taught by a religious organizat ion.


?
 New findings abouthow animals communicat e are challenging the current dogma in the field.


Religious dogma and scient ific dogma are somet imes at odds, as in argument s bet ween those who believe in the biblical st ory of creat ion and those who believe in evolut ion. Since all dogma resist s change, argument s of any kind are harder to resolve when both sides are dogmatic in their beliefs. Dogma and dogmatic are generally used disapprovingly; it 's always other people who believe unquest ioningly in dogma and who take a dogmat ic approach to important issues.
 
==========grat is                     Without charge; free.


?
 The service is grat is, since it comes as part of a package deal.


Gratis comes from the Latin word for "favor"; so in English a part y favor is a small it em given grat is to everyone at t ending a part y. Gratis is used as both an adject ive ("The drinks were grat is") and an adverb ("Drinks were served grat is"). Buthowever it 's used, it means "free."
 
==========eureka                        An exclamat ion used to express triumph and delight on a discovery.


?
 The mountain t own of Eureka, California, was named for the cries of delight by prospect ors when they discovered gold in them thar hills.


Eureka means "I have found" in Greek. The st ory goes that the Greek invent or Archimedes, given the task of det ermining the purit y of gold in a crown, shout ed "Eureka!" one day aft er st epping int o a bath and making wat er slop over the side, when he suddenly realized that the weight of wat er displaced indicat ed the bulk of his body, but thata larger body made of light er mat t er might weigh the same but would displace more wat er. Thus, a crown in which light er metal had secret ly been mixed with the gold would reveal it self in the same way. The st ory may not be true, but we st ill shout "Eureka!" when we make a sudden, welcome discovery.
 
==========per se                    By, of, or in it self; as such.


?
 He claims that the reason for the invasion wasn't oil per se, butrather the country's dangerous military power, which had been made possible by it s oil.


We generally use per se to dist inguish bet ween something in it s narrow sense and some larger thing that itrepresent s. Thus, you may have no object ion to educat ional t est ing per se, butrather to the way t est ing is done. An opposit ion part y may at tack a president 's policy not because they dislike the policy per se but because they want to weaken the president . And when New York's police chief decided to crack down on small crimes, it wasn't the small crimes per se that were his target , but inst ead the larger crimes which he believed would be reduced because of this new approach.
 
==========opus     A creat ive work, especially a musical composit ion or set  of  composit ions numbered in order of publicat ion.


?
 Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is also known as Opus (Op.) 125.


A lit erary opus is oft en a single novel, though the word may somet imes refer to all of a writ er's works. But opus  normally  is used for musical works. Mendelssohn's Opus  90 is  his Italian Symphony, for example, and Brahms's Op. 77 is his Violin Concert o. Since many composers' works were never given opus numbers in an orderly way, they now oft en have catalog numbers assigned by lat er scholars. So Haydn's Symphony No. 104 is Hob.104 (Hob. is short for Anthony van Hoboken, the cataloger), and Mozart 's Marriage of Figaro is K.492 (K. stands for Ludwig K?
chel).
 
==========impet us                     (1) A driving force or impulse; something that makes a person try or work hard; incent ive. (2) Moment um.


?
 The promise of a nice bonus gave us all an added impet us for finishing the project on t ime.


An impet us can be something posit ive and pleasant , or something negat ive and unpleasant , but in either case it st imulat es act ion. The need to earn a living provides many people with the impet us to drag themselves out of bed five mornings a week. On the other two days, the impet us might be the smell of bacon cooking, or the idea of an early-morning round of golf. Impetus can be used either with an or the in front of it ("The accident provided an impet us for changing the safet y regulat ions") or without them ("His discoveries have given impet us to further research").
 
==========thesis         (1) An opinion or proposit ion thata person present s and tries to prove by argument . (2) An ext ended paper that contains the result s of original research, especially one writ t en by a candidat e for an academic degree.


?
 She's done all the coursework needed for her mast er's degree buthasn't yet complet ed her thesis.


In high school, college, or graduat e school, st udent s oft en have to writ e a thesis on a t opic in their major field of st udy. In many fields, a final thesis is the biggest challenge involved in get t ing a mast er's degree, and the same is true for st udent s st udying for a Ph.D. (a Ph.D. thesis is oft en called a dissertation). Buta thesis may also be an idea; so in the course of the paper the st udent may put forth several theses (not ice the plural form) and at t empt to prove them.

MAND UND SANCT LOQU VIR VAL CRE/CRET FUS GreekandLatinBorrowings
Quiz24-1 Quiz24-2 Quiz24-3 Quiz24-4 Quiz24-5 ReviewQuizzes24

MAND comes from mandare, Latin for "entrust " or "order." A command is an order; a commandment is also an order, but usually one that comes from God. And a commando unit carries out orders for special military act ions.
 
==========mandat e                          (1) A formal command. (2) Permission to act , given by the people to their representat ives.


?
 The new president claimed his landslide vict ory was a mandat e from the vot ers to end the war.


A mandat e from a leader is a command you can'trefuse. But that kind of personal command is rarely the meaning of mandate t oday; much more common are connect ed with inst it ut ions. Thus, the Clean Air Act was a mandat e from Congress to clean up air pollut ion-and since mandate is also a verb, we could say inst ead that the Clear Air Act mandated new restrict ions on air pollut ion. Elect ions are oft en int erpret ed as mandat es from the public for certain kinds of act ion. But since a polit ician is not justa symbol of certain policies butalso an individual who mighthappen to have an awfully nice smile, it can be risky to int erpret most elect ions as mandat ing anything atall.
 
==========mandat ory
Required.


?
 If at t endance at the meet ing hadn't been mandat ory, she would have just gone home.


Something mandat ory is the result of a mandate or order, which usually comes in the form of a law, rule, or regulat ion. Today there seem to be a lot of these mandat es, so mandat ory seat belt s, mandat ory inspect ions for industries, and mandat ory prison sent ences for violent crimes are regularly in the news. But mandat ory ret irementatage 65, which used to be common, is now illegal in most cases.
 
==========commandeer
 To take possession of  something by force, especially for military purposes.


?
 No sooner had they start ed their meet ing than the boss showed up and commandeered the conference room.


Military forces have always had the power to commandeer houses. The Declarat ion of Independence complains about the way the Brit ish soldiers have done it , and the third Amendment to the Const it ut ion stat es that the commandeering of people's houses shall be done only in a way prescribed by law. Almostanything-food, supplies, livest ock, et c.-can be militarily commandeered when the need arises. But you don'thave to be in the military for someone to "pull rank" on you: Your father may commandeer the car just when you were about to take it out for the evening, your t eacher may commandeer your cell phone as you're t ext ing in the middle of class, or your older sist er may commandeer the TV remot e to wat ch some lousy dancing compet it ion.
 
==========remand                    (1) To order a case sent back to another court or agency for further act ion. (2) To send a prisoner back int o cust ody to await further trial or sent encing.


?
 The stat e supreme courthad remanded the case to the superior court , instruct ing it to consider the new evidence.


Remand means "order back" or "send back." Aft er losing a case in a lower court , lawyers will frequent ly appeal it to a higher court . If the higher court looks at the case and sees that the lower court made certain kinds of errors, it will simply remand it , while t elling the lower courthow it  fell short  the first  t ime: by not  instruct ing the jury thoroughly, for example, or by not taking int o accounta recentrelat ed court decision.
 
==========UND comes int o English from the Latin words unda, "wave," and undare, "t o rise in waves," "t o surge or flood." Undulations are waves or wavelike things or mot ions, and to undulate is to rise and fall in a wavelike way.
 
==========undulant                           (1) Rising and falling in waves. (2) Wavy in form, out line, or surface.


?
 The man's undulant , sinist er movement s reminded her of a poisonous snake about to strike.


The surface of a freshly plowed field is undulant . A range of rolling hills could  be  called undulant , as could the shift ing sands of the Sahara. A wat erbed mat tress is oft en lit erally undulant . And a field of wheat will undulate or sway in the wind, like the waves of the sea.
 
==========inundat e                           (1) To cover with a flood or overflow. (2) To overwhelm.


?
 As news of the singer's death spread, retailers were inundat ed with orders for all his old recordings.


In the summer of 1993, record rains in the Midwest caused the Mississippi River to overflow it s banks, break through levees, and inundat e the ent ire countryside; such an inundation hadn't been seen for at leasta hundred years. By contrast , the Nile River inundat ed it s ent ire valley every year, bringing the rich black silt that made the valley one of the most fert ile places on earth. (The inundat ions ceased with the complet ion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970.) Whenever a crit ical issue is being debat ed, the Whit e House and Congressional offices are inundat ed with phone calls and e-mails, justas a t own may be inundat ed with complaint s when it start s charging a fee for garbage pickup.
 
==========redound                        (1) To have an effect for good or bad. (2) To rebound or reflect .


?
 Each new military vict ory redounded to the glory of the king, whose brilliance as a leader was now praised and feared throughout Europe.


Redound has had a confusing hist ory. It s original meaning was simply "overflow." But since the prefix re- oft en means "back," the lat er meaning "result " may have arisen because flowing back
-on a beach, for example-is a result of the original flowing. Redound has long been confused with other words such as resound and rebound, so t oday "rebound" is another of it s standard meanings. As examples of it s usual meaning, we could say that the prohibit ion of alcohol in 1919 redounded unint ent ionally to the benefit of gangst ers such as Al Capone-and that Capone's  jailing  on  tax-evasion  charges  redounded to the   credit   of   the   famous "Unt ouchables."
 
==========redundancy
 (1) The stat e of being extra or unnecessary. (2) Needless repet it ion.


?
 A certain amount of redundancy can help make a speaker's point s clear, but t oo much can be annoying.


Redundancy, closely relat ed to redound, has stayed close to the original meaning of "overflow" or "more than necessary." Avoiding redundancy is one of the prime rules of good writ ing. ""In the modern world of t oday" contains a redundancy; so does "He died of fatal wounds" and "For the mut ual benefit of both part ies." Butredundancy doesn't just occur in language. "Data redundancy" means keeping the same comput er data in more than one place as a safet y measure, and a backup syst em in an airplane may provide redundancy, again for the sake of safet y.

==========SANCT, meaning "holy," comes from the Latin word sanctus. Thus, sanctity means "holiness." In ancient Greece, a spot could be sanctified, or "made holy," by a group of priest s who carried outa solemn rit ual; these might be spot s where fumes arose from a crack in the earth or where a spring of clear wat er flowed out of the ground, and a t emple might be built there for worship of a god.
 
==========sanct ion
 To give approval t o.


?
 The bill's opponent s claimed thatremoving criminal penalt ies for drug possession would amount to sanct ioning drug use.


Sanction originally meant "make holy" or "give official church approval t o." The word st ill has a solemn sound to it , so sanct ioning is something generally done by an inst it ut ion or government , though not necessarily by a church. So a college may sanct ion-or "give it s blessing t o"-the use of office space by a gay organizat ion, or a hot -rod associat ion may sanct ion two new tracks for official races. But sanction is also a noun, which may have two near-opposit e meanings, "approval" and "penalt y." Thus, a company may be accused of giving it s sanction to illegal act ivit ies. But when two or more countries impose sanct ions on another country, it oft en involves cut t ing off trade. No wonder sanction is such a tricky word for so many of us.
 
==========sanct imonious
   Pret ending to be more religiously observant  or morally bet t er than other people.


?
 The candidat es' speeches were sanct imonious from beginning to end, filled with st ories abouthow their deep faith was the basis for everything they did.


Making a show of your religious moralit y has always struck some people the wrong way, including Jesus. In his Sermon on the Mount , Jesus preaches that , when we give away money for charit y, we shouldn't let our lefthand know what our righthand is doing-that is, the giving should be done for it s own sake and other people shouldn't be t old about it . Those who make a display of how good and pious they are called hypocrit es. But sanctimony, or sanctimoniousness, has oft en been a good strat egy for American polit icians, many of whom have found ita great way to win vot es.
 
==========sacrosanct                         (1) Most sacred or holy. (2) Treat ed as if holy and therefore immune from crit icism or dist urbance of any kind.


?
 Lot s of expert s have crit icized the governor's educat ion program, but it 's regarded as sacrosanct by members of her own part y.


Sacrosanct means lit erally "made holy by a sacred rit e," and in it s original use the word was reserved for things of the ut mostholiness. But sacrosanct  is  now  used to describe  a quest ionable sacredness which nevertheless makes something immune  from  at tack  or violat ion; that is, the person using the word usually doesn'tregard the thing as sacred atall. So to call a government program sacrosanct is to imply that others regard itas unt ouchable. And a piece of writ ing is more likely to be thought of as sacrosanct by it s author than by the edit or who has to fix it up.
 
==========sanct uary
  (1) A holy place, such as a church or t emple, or the mostholy part of one. (2) A place of safet y, refuge, and prot ect ion.


?
 The midt own park is a tranquil sanct uary amidst the cit y's heat , noise, and bust le.


Hist orically, churches have been places  where  fugit ives  could  seek  at  least  t emporary prot ect ion from the law. In Anglo-Saxon England, churches and churchyards generally provided 40 days of immunit y, and neither the sheriffs nor the army would ent er to seize the out law. But gradually the right of sanct uary was eroded. In 1486 sanct uary for the crime of treason was disallowed, and sanct uary for most other crimes was severely restrict ed by Henry V I and lat er abolished. In the 1980s many U.S. churches provided sanct uary to polit ical refugees from Central America, and the U.S. government most ly chose not to int erfere. Today, wildlife sanct uaries provide prot ect ion for the species within it s  boundaries,  and  farm-animal sanct uaries now rescue livest ock from abuse and starvat ion.
 
==========LOQU comes from the Latin verb loqui, "t o talk." An eloquent preacher speaks fluent ly, forcefully, and expressively. And a dummy's words come out of a ventriloquist's mouth-or perhaps out of his belly (in Latin, venter).
 
==========colloquium
      A conference in which various speakers take t urns lect uring on a subjectand then answering quest ions about it .


?
 There's a colloquium at Yale on Noah Webst er in Sept ember, where she's scheduled to deliver a paper.


A colloquy is a conversat ion, and especially an important , high-level discussion. Colloquy and colloquium once meant the same thing, though t oday colloquium always refers to a conference. Because of it s old "conversat ion" meaning, however, a colloquium is a t ype of conference with important quest ion-and-answer periods.
 
==========soliloquy
  A dramat ic speech thatrepresent s a series of unspoken thought s.


?
 Film charact ers never have onscreen soliloquies, though they may t ell us their thought s in a voiceover.


Since solus means "alone" in Latin, soliloquies take place when a charact er is alone onstage, or maybe spot light ed off to one side of a dark stage. Novels have no trouble in expressing to the reader a charact er's personal thought s, but such expression is less nat ural to stage drama. The soliloquies of Shakespeare-in Hamlet ("To be or not to be"), Macbeth ("Tomorrow and  t omorrow and t omorrow"), Romeo and Juliet ("But soft ! what light from yonder window breaks"), et c.-are the most famous, but modern playwright s such as Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, and Sam Shepard have also employed them.
 
==========colloquial
    Conversat ional in st yle.


?
 The author, though obviously a professional writ er, uses a colloquial st yle in this new book.


Since colloquy means basically "conversat ion," colloquial language is the language almostall of us speak. It uses contract ions ("can't ," "it 's," "they've"), possibly some slang, lot s of short words and not many long ones. But our language usually changes when we writ e, becoming more formal and somet imes even "lit erary." Except in e-mails and t ext messages, many people never writ e a contract ion or use the word "I", and avoid informal words complet ely. But colloquial language isn't necessarily  bad  in  writ ing, and  it 's  somet imes  more  appropriat e than the alt ernat ive.
 
==========loquacious
    Apt to talk t oo much; talkat ive.


?
 She had hoped to read quiet ly on the plane, but the loquacious salesman in the next seat made it nearly impossible.


A loquacious speaker can leave a big audience st ifling it s yawns aft er the first 45 minut es, and the loquaciousness of a dinner guest can keep everyone else from get t ing a word in edgewise. Loquacious let t ers used to go on for pages, and a loquacious author might produce a 1,200- page novel. Lincoln's brief 269-word Get t ysburg Address was delivered aft er  a t wo-hour, 13,000-word speech by America's most famous orat or, a windbag of loquacity.

==========VIR is Latin for "man." A virtue is a good qualit y-originally, the kind of qualit y an ideal man possessed. And virtuous behavior is morally excellent . All in all, the Romans seem to have believed that being a man was a good thing.
 
==========virilit y                          Energet ic, vigorous manhood; masculinit y.


?
 For his ent ire life he believed thatanyone who had been a Marine had established his virilit y beyond any doubt .


Luckily, there's no doubtabout what virilit y is, since it 's depict ed on the covers of dozens of new romance novels every month! A mast erful and dominat ing manner, a splendid bared chest , a full head of lustrous hair, and an array of st unning cost umes seem to be what 's required. (Virile trait s oft en missing in these men are hair on the chestand any hint of fut ure baldness.) High-school foot ball provides a showplace for demonstrat ions of adolescent virilit y, and for years aft erward virile high-school players can keep using foot ball language in their business life: "get to the red zone," "Hail Mary pass," "move the ball," and on and on.
 
==========triumvirat e                       (1) A commission or government  of  three. (2) A group or associat ion of three.


?
 A triumvirat e slowly emerged as the inner circle of the Whit e House, and the vice president wasn'tamong them.


The first triumvirat e of the Roman Republic, which consist ed of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, was simply an alliance or part nership, nota formal inst it ut ion of the government . The alliance didn't last long, however, and Caesar event ually emerged with t otal power. This led to his assassinat ion, aft er which a second triumvirat e t ook over, with Octavian, Mark Ant ony, and Lepidus dividing the Roman world among themselves. But these triumvirs also soon t urned on one another, with Octavian alone taking power; in t ime he would become Rome's first emperor.
 
==========virago                         A loud, bad-t empered, overbearing woman.


?
 The staff called her a virago and other things behind her back, but everyone was respect ful of her abilit ies.


The original Latin meaning of virago was "female warrior." But in lat er cent uries the meaning shift ed t oward the negat ive. The most famous virago in English lit erat ure is the ferocious Kat e in Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Some hist orical viragoes have also become famous. Agrippina poisoned her husband, the Emperor Claudius, so that  her son Nero could take his place (but it was Nero himself who event ually had her assassinat ed). And Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, a powerful virago of the 12th cent ury, was imprisoned by her husband, King Henry I of England, aft er she encouraged their sons to rebel againsthim. Today some people are beginning to use virago admiringly again.
 
==========virt uosit y
      Great t echnical skill, especially in the pract ice of a fine art .


?
 Playing with the band, his virt uosit y doesn't show through; you really have to hear him solo to appreciat e him.


Virtuosity is used part icularly to describe musicians, butalso oft en for writ ers, act ors, dancers, and athlet es. A virtuoso is a highly skilled performer, and a virtuoso performance is one thatast onishes the audience by it s feat s. In ancient Greece the  cit ies  would  hold  male compet it ions in acrobat ics, conjuring, public recit ing, blowing the trumpet , and act ing out scenes from Homer's epics, the winners of which would have been praised as virtuous, or "full of manly virt ues."
 
==========VAL has as it s basic meaning "strength," from the Latin verb valere, meaning "t o be worthy, healthy, or strong" and  "t o  have  power  or  influence."  So evaluating  a  house  involves det ermining how healthy it is. A valid license or credit card is one that 's st ill in effect , and a valid proof is one that provides strong evidence.
 
==========valor                  Personal bravery in the face of danger.


?
 The gun duels of the Old West were invent ed by a novelist inspired by the valor of the knight s in medieval t ournament s.


Valor in uniform is st ill rewarded by medals. Many American civic organizat ions award a Medal of Valor for physical courage, and the Air Force Medal of Honor displays the single word "Valor." The somewhat old-fashioned adject ive valorous more oft en describes warriors of the past . But valiant is st ill in common use, though it less oft en describes military courage than other kinds of bravery or effort .
 
==========equivalent
  (1) Equal in force, amount , value, area, or volume. (2) Similar or virt ually ident ical in effect or funct ion.


?
 A square can be equivalent to a triangle in area, but not in shape.


Modern democracies have inst it ut ions and offices thatare roughly equivalent to those found in others: the president of the Unit ed Stat es has his Brit ish equivalent in the prime minist er, for instance, and the U.S. Congress finds it s equivalent in the Brit ish Parliament . The heavily armored knight on his greatarmored horse has been called the Middle Ages' equivalent of the army tank. In none of these examples are the two things ident ical to each other; they're simply very similar in their effect or purpose or nat ure, which is what equivalence usually implies.
 
==========prevalent
  Widely accept ed, favored, or pract iced; widespread.


?
 On some campuses Frisbees seem to be more prevalent than schoolbooks, especially in the spring.


Many diseases that were prevalenta cent ury ago have been controlled by advances in medicine. Smallpox was prevalent on several cont inent s for many cent uries, and when Europeans brought it with them to the Americas, it killed more American Indians than the armed set t lers did. But prevalent doesn't just describe diseases. One ideal of male or female beaut y may be prevalent in a part icular societ y and quit e a different ideal in another. In the 1950s and '60s, there was a prevalent not ion that if you went swimming less than an hour aft er eat ing you might drown because of st omach cramps-which goes to show that not every prevalent idea is exact ly true.
 
==========validat e                 (1) To make legally valid; give official approval t o. (2) To support or confirm the validit y of.


?
 It will take many more research st udies to validat e a theory as far-reaching as this one.


Validat ing a pass might  require get t ing an official stamp on it . Validat ing experimental data mightrequire checking itagainst data from further experiment s.

==========CRE/CRET comes from the Latin verb crescere, which means both "t o come int o being" and "t o grow." So a crescendo in music occurs when the music is growing louder, and a decrescendo when it 's growing soft er.
 
==========crescent                         (1) The moon bet ween the new moon and first quart er, and bet ween the last quart er and the next new moon. (2) Anything shaped like the crescent moon.


?
 The symbol of Islam is a crescent moon with a star bet ween the point s, an astronomical impossibilit y.


Crescent means basically "growing," since a crescent moon is in the process of "growing" to a full moon. A crescent wrench, with it s open end (unlike the kind of wrench thathas an almost circular end), can be found in almostany household. A croissant, or crescent pastry, is a breakfast staple. The curving region called the Fert ile Crescent , which stret ches from the Persian Gulf up through Iraq, across to Lebanon and Israel, and down int o Egypt 's Nile River valley, was the birthplace of civilizat ion, where weaving, pot t ery, domest icat ed livest ock, irrigat ion farming, and writ ing all firstappeared.
 
==========accret ion                         (1) Growth or enlargement by gradual buildup. (2) A product of such buildup.


?
 The house and barn were linked by an accret ion of out buildings, each joined to the next .


The slow accret ion of scient ific knowledge over many cent uries has t urned int o an avalanche in our t ime. Any accret ion of ice on a grounded jet will result in takeoff delays because of the danger it poses. The land area of the Mississippi Delta increases every year from the accret ion of soil washed down the Mississippi River, though the accret ions happen so slowly that it 's difficult to det ectany increase atall. Accretion is oft en used in scient ific writ ing; it s usual verb form, accrue, is more oft en used in financial cont ext s ("This figure doesn't count the accrued int erest on the invest ment s").
 
==========excrescence                   (1) A project ion of growth, especially when abnormal. (2) A disfiguring, unnecessary, or unwant ed mark or part .


?
 The new warehouse squat t ed like some hideous excrescence on the landscape.


Wart s and pimples are common excrescences that can usually be wiped out with medicat ion; other excrescences such as cyst s and t umors need to be removed surgically. Mushrooms are the excrescences of underground fungus net works. Some people consider slang words to be vulgar excrescences on the English language, but others consider slang the most colorful vocabulary of all.
 
==========increment                       (1) Something gained or added, especially as one of a series of regular addit ions or  as a t iny increase in amount . (2)  The amount or  ext ent of change, especially the posit ive or negat ive change in value of one or more variables.


?
 Her bank accounthas grown weekly by increment s of $50 for the past two years.


Increment is used in many t echnical fields, butalso nont echnically. Incremental increases in drug dosages are used for experimental purposes. Incremental tax increases are easier to swallow than sudden large increases. Incremental changes of any kind may be hard to not ice, but can be very significant in the long run. Rome wasn't built in a day, but was inst ead built up by increment s from a couple of villages  in  the  10th  cent ury  B.C. to the  capital  of  the Medit erranean world in the 1st cent ury A.D.
 
==========FUS comes from the Latin verb fundere, "t o pour out " or "t o melt ." A fuse depends on melt ing metal to break an overloaded circuit . Nuclear fusion involves the "melt ing" t ogether of light nuclei to form heavier nuclei, and fusion cuisine brings t ogether the cooking of two or more cult ures.
 
==========transfusion
 (1) The process of transferring a fluid and especially blood int o a blood vessel. (2) Something transfused.


?
 The transfusion gave her an immediat e burst of energy, and her friends were ast onished when they arrived at the hospital thataft ernoon.


When blood transfusions were firstat t empt ed by Europeans in the early 1600s, they were met with skept icism, since the established pract ice was to bleed pat ient s, not transfuse them with blood. Some pat ient s were transfused with animal blood, and so many died as a result that by 1700 transfusions had been widely out lawed. Not unt il 1900 were the major blood groups (A, B, AB, and O) recognized, making transfusions safe and effect ive.
 
==========effusive                       (1) Given to excessive display of feeling. (2) Freely expressed.


?
 At the vict ory part y she lavished effusive praise on all her support ers for almosthalf an hour.


Since to effuse is to "pour out ," an effusive person makes a habit of pouring out emot ions. Greet ing someone effusively may include greathugs and wet kisses. Academy Award winners  t end to become embarrassingly effusive once they've got the microphone. Butat least effusiveness is generally an expression of posit ive rather than negat ive emot ions.
 
==========profusion
      Greatabundance.


?
 In May the trees and flowers bloom with almost delirious profusion.


A profusion is lit erally a "pouring forth," so a profusion of gift s is a wealth or abundance of gift s. A profusely illustrat ed book is filled to overflowing with pict ures. A bad social error should be followed   by profuse  apologies, and  profound  grat it ude  should  be  expressed  with  profuse thanks.

 As the soft light of dawn suffused the landscape, they could hear the loons crying over the lake.


The odors of baking may suffuse a room, and so may the light of a sunset . A face may be suffused (that is, filled, butalso probably flushed) with joy, or hope, or love.

==========Greek and Latin Borrowings

apologia
     A defense, especially of one's own ideas, opinions, or act ions.


?
 His resignat ion speech was an eloquentapologia for his controversial act ions as chairman.


An apologia and an apology usually aren't the same thing. An apology includes an admission of wrongdoing, butan apologia rarely apologizes in this sense, inst ead seeking to just ify what was done. So, for example, in 1992 some of the books published for the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage were apologias explaining why European powers such as Spain act ed as they did in the New World: because, for example, the Azt ecs were a cruel people, pract icing human sacrifice in grot esque ways (vict ims were skinned, and their skins were worn by the high priest s), and Christ ianit y hoped to reform them. Of course, the Spanish Inquisit ion was t ort uring and execut ing nonbelievers at the same t ime-but that would be the subject of other apologias.
 
==========atrium                      (1) An open rectangular pat io around which a house is built . (2) A court with a skylight in a many-st oried building.

 Best of all, their new home had a large atrium, where they could eat breakfast in the fresh air in spring and summer.


In malls and grand office buildings t oday, the enclosed atrium, oft en with full-size trees growing in itand high indoor balconies with hanging vines, has become a common archit ect ural feat ure. But the original atria (not ice the unusual plural) were open to the sky and occupied the cent er of a house or villa in ancientrome. The open Roman court yard allowed air to circulat e and light to ent er, and even it s plant ings helped cool the house. Sit uat ing the cooking fireplace in the atrium was another way of keeping the house it self cool. St ill t oday, houses around the Medit erranean Sea and in tropical Latin America oft en have int ernal court yards.
 
==========oligarchy
   A government in which power is in the hands of a small group.


?
 The populat ion was shackled by an iron-willed oligarchy that dictat ed every aspect of their lives and ruthlessly crushed any hint of rebellion.


Oligarchy combines root s from the Greek words oligos, meaning "few," and archos, meaning "leader or ruler." In ancient Greece, an aristocracy was government by the "best " (in Greek, aristos) cit izens. An oligarchy was a corrupt ed arist ocracy, one in which a few evil men unjust ly seized power and used it to further their own ends. Since at least 1542, oligarchy has been used in English to describe oppressive government s of the kind that serve the int erest s of a few very wealthy families.
 
==========encomium
 Glowing, enthusiast ic praise, or an expression of such praise.


?
 The surprise  guestat the  farewell part y was the  school's most famous graduat e, who delivered a heart felt encomium to the woman he called his favorit e t eacher of all.


Encomium comes straight from Latin. Mark Ant ony's encomium to the dead Caesar in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar ("Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears") is one of the most famous encomiums of all t ime, while Ben Jonson's encomium to the dead Shakespeare ("He was not of an age, but for all t ime") has also been widely read and discussed. The Brit ish poet laureat e is expect ed to compose poet ic encomiums to mark special event s or to praise a person honored by the stat e. And any awards banquet  is thick with encomiums, with each speaker trying to out do the last in praise of those being honored.
 
==========neurosis                       A mental and emot ional disorder that is less severe than a psychosis and may involve various pains, anxiet ies, or phobias.


?
 He has a neurosis about dirt , and is constant ly washing his hands.


A neurosis is a somewhat mild mental disorder; unexplained anxiet y at tacks, unreasonable fears, depression, and physical sympt oms thatare mentally caused are all examples of neurotic condit ions. A superst it ious person who compulsively knocks on wood or avoids anything with the number 13 might be suffering from a harmless neurosis. Buta severe neurosis such as agoraphobia (see agoraphobia) can be very harmful, making a person a prisoner of his or her home. Neurosis is based on the Greek word for "nerve," since unt il quit e recent ly neurot ic behavior was oft en blamed on the nerves. Neurosis is usually contrast ed with psychosis, which includes a considerably more serious group of condit ions.
 
==========opprobrium
(1) Something that brings disgrace. (2) A public disgrace thatresult s from conduct considered wrong or bad.


?
 The writ ers of the New Testamenthold the Pharisees up to opprobrium for their hypocrisy and hollow spirit ualit y.


Wit ches have long been the object s of opprobrium; in Europe in the 16th and 17th cent uries, women  thought to be  wit ches  were  burned  by  the  thousands. The opprobrious  crime  of treason could likewise result in the mosthideous t ort ure and execut ion. In The Scarlet Letter, the sin of adult ery in Puritan t imes brought opprobrium on Hest er Prynne. Today the country of Israel is the object of opprobrium in many countries, while the Palest inians suffer similar opprobrium in others. And mere smokers, or even overweight  people, may somet imes feel themselves to be the object s of mild opprobrium.
 
==========referendum                          (1) The referring of legislat ive measures to the vot ers for approval or reject ion. (2) A vot e on such a measure.

 The referendum on the tax needed for construct ing the new hospital passed by seven vot es.


Referendum is a Latin word, but it s modern meaning only dat es from the 19th cent ury, when a new const it ut ion adopt ed by Swit zerland stat ed that the vot ers could vot e direct ly on certain issues. Thus, a referendum is a measure that 's referred (that is, sent on) to the people. Since the U.S. Const it ut ion doesn't provide for referenda (not ice the common plural form) at the nat ional level, referenda t end to be on local and stat e issues. In most locales, a few quest ions usually appear on the ballotat elect ion t ime, oft en involving such issues as new zoning ordinances, new taxes for schools, and new limit s on spending.
 
==========ult imat um
 A final proposal, condit ion, or demand, especially one whose reject ion will result in forceful act ion.


?
 The ult imat um to Iraq in 1991 demanding that it withdraw from Kuwait was ignored, and a U.S.-led invasion was the response.


An ult imat um is usually issued by a stronger power to a weaker one, since it wouldn't carry much weight if the one giving the ult imat um couldn't back up it s threat . Near the end of World War I, the Allied powers issued an ult imat um to Japan: surrender complet ely or face the consequences. Japan reject ed the ult imat um, and within days the U.S. had dropped at omic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing some 200,000 people.

Quiz25-1 Quiz25-2 Quiz25-3 Quiz25-4 Quiz25-5 ReviewQuizzes25

VERB comes from the Latin verbum, meaning "word." A verb-or act ion word-appears in some form in every complet e sent ence. To express something verbally-or to verbalize something-is to say it or writ e it .
 
==========verbose                       Using more words than are needed; wordy.


?
 The writ ing st yle in government publicat ions has oft en been both dry and verbose-a deadly combinat ion.


Americans brought up on fast -paced TV shows and act ion films have lostany pat ience they once had for verbosity. So mostamerican writ ing is brisk, and American speakers usually don't wast e many words. But many of us love our own voices and opinions and don'trealize we're being verbose unt il our list eners start st ifling their yawns. And st udent s st ill try to fill up the pages of their t erm papers with unneeded verbosit y.
 
==========proverb              A brief, oft en-repeat ed stat ement that expresses a general truth or common observat ion.


?
 "Wast e not , want not " used to be a favorit e proverb in many households.


Proverbs probably appeared with the dawn of language. Sayings such as "A st it ch in t ime saves nine," or "Pride goeth before a fall," or "Least said, soonest mended," or "To everything there is a season" are easily memorized nugget s of wisdom. But the convenient thing about proverbs is that there's oft en one for every point of view. For every "Look before you leap" there's a "He who hesitat es is lost ." "A fool and his money are soon part ed" can be count ered with "To make money you have to spend money." A cynic once observed, "Proverbs are invaluable treasures to dunces with good memories."
 
==========verbat im
  In the exact words; word for word.


?
 It t urned out that the writ er had lift ed long passages verbat im from an earlier, forgot t en biography of the stat esman.


Verbatim comes direct ly from Latin int o English with the same spelling and meaning. Memorizing famous speeches, poems, or lit erary passages is a good way to both train the memory and absorb the classic t ext s of our lit erat ure and cult ure. At one t ime the abilit y to recit e verbat im the Get t ysburg Address, the beginning of the Declarat ion of Independence, and great  speeches from Shakespeare was the mark of a well-educat ed person. But  when that language was quot ed by a writ er, he or she was always careful to put quotat ion marks around itand t ell readers who the true author was.
 
==========verbiage                        An excess of words, oft en with lit t le cont ent ; wordiness.


?
 The agency's report was full of unnecessary verbiage, which someone should have edit ed out before the report was published.


Government  report s  are  not orious  for their unfort unat e  t endency  t oward  empt y  verbiage, through part of the reason is simply that officials are anxious to be following all the rules. Legal document s are also generally full of verbiage, part ly because lawyers want to be sure that every last possibilit y has been covered and no loopholes have been left . But writ ing that contains unneeded verbiage is oft en trying to disguise it s lack of real substance or clarit y of thought . And every writ er, including government workers and lawyers, should be constant ly on  the lookout for opport unit ies to hit the Delet e key.
 
==========SIMIL/SIMUL come from the Latin adject ive similis, meaning "like, resembling, similar," and the verb simulare, "t o make like."  Two similar  things  resemble  each  other. Two simultaneous act ivit ies proceed at the same t ime. And a facsimile, such as you mightreceive from your fax machine, looks exact ly the same as the original.
 
==========simile        A  figure  of  speech, introduced  by as   or like, that  makes  a  point  of comparison bet ween two things different in all other respect s.


?
 He part icularly liked the simile he'd thought of for the last line of the song's chorus, "It felt like a bullet in his heart ."


Fict ion, poetry, and  philosophy  have  been  full of  similes  for  cent uries. In  fact , the  oldest lit erat ure known to us uses similes, along with their close relat ives known as metaphors (see metaphorical). This suggest s that similes are an essent ial part of imaginat ive writ ing in all t imes and all cult ures. When Tennyson, describing an eagle, writ es "And like a thunderbolthe falls," he's using a simile, since the line makes a specific comparison. "The road was a ribbon of moonlight " could be called a metaphor, though "The road was like a ribbon of moonlight " would be a simile.
 
==========assimilat e                     (1) To  take  in  and  thoroughly  understand. (2) To  cause to become part of a different societ y or cult ure.


?
 One of the tradit ional strengths of American societ y has been it s abilit y to assimilat e one group of immigrant s aft er another.


Assimilate comes from the Latin verb assimulare, "t o make similar," and it originally applied to the process by which food is taken int o the body and absorbed int o the syst em. In a similar way, a fact can be taken int o the mind, thoroughly digest ed, and absorbed int o one's st ore of knowledge. A newcomer to a job or a subject mustassimilat e an oft en confusing mass of informat ion; only aft er it 's been thoroughly absorbed can the person make int elligent use of it . An immigrant family assimilat es int o it s new cult ure by gradually adopt ing a new language and the habit s of their new neighbors-a process that 's always easier for the children than for the parent s.
 
==========simulacrum
     A copy, especially a superficial likeness or imitat ion.


?
 As a boy he had filled his bedroom with model fight er jet s, and these simulacra had kepthis flying fantasies act ive for years.


In it s original meaning, a simulacrum is simply a representat ion of something else; so an original oil paint ing, marble stat ue, or plast ic figurine could all be simulacra (not ice the plural form) in the old sense. But t oday the word usually means a copy that 's meant to subst it ut e for the real thing-and usually a cheap and inferior copy, a pale imitat ion of the original. So in old Persia a beaut ifully laid out garden was a simulacrum of paradise. Some countries' government s are mere simulacra of democracy, since the people in power always st eal the elect ions by miscount ing the vot es. And a bad act or might do a simulacrum of grief on the stage that doesn't convince anyone.
 
==========simulat e
(1) To take on the appearance or effect of something, oft en in order to deceive. (2) To make a realist ic imitat ion of something, such as a physical environment .


?
 The armed services have made ext ensive use of video games to simulat e the act ual experience of warfare for their recruit s.


The zircon, that favorit e of home shopping channels, simulat es a diamond-more or less. A skilled furrier can dye lower-grade furs to simulat e real mink. A skilled actress can simulat e a range of emot ions from absolut e joy to crushing despair. And an apparat us that simulat es the hazards of driving while int oxicat ed is likely to provide some very real benefit s.

==========SCEND  comes  from the  Latin  verb scandere, "t o  climb."  The  staircase  we ascend to our bedroom at night we will descend the next morning, since what goes up must come down.
 
==========transcend                           To rise above the limit s of; overcome, surpass.


?
 His defeat in the elect ion had been t erribly hard on him, and it t ook two years before he finally felthe had transcended the bit t erness ithad produced.


Great leaders are expect ed to transcend the limitat ions of polit ics, especially during wart ime and nat ional  crises. A  great  writ er  may  transcend  geographical  boundaries to become int ernat ionally respect ed. And certain laws of human nat ure seem to transcend hist orical periods and hold true for all t imes and all places.
 
==========condescend                       (1) To st oop to a level of lesser importance or dignit y. (2) To behave as if superior.


?
 Every so oft en my big brother would condescend to take me to a movie, but only when my parent s made him.


Back when societ y was more rigidly struct ured, condescend didn't sound so negat ive. People of higher rank, power, or social posit ion had to overlook certain established rules of behavior if they wished to have social dealings with people of lower stat us, but such condescension was usually gracious and court eous. In t oday's more classless societ y, the t erm implies a manner that may be slight ly offensive. A poor relat ion is unlikely to be grat eful to a wealthy and condescending relat ive who passes on her secondhand clothes, and employees atan office part y may not be thrilled when the boss's wife condescends to mingle with them. Oft en the word is used rather unseriously, as when a friend comment s thata snoot y sales clerk condescended to wait on her aft er ignoring her for several minut es.
 
==========descendant
   (1) One thathas come down from another or from a common st ock. (2) One deriving direct ly from a forerunner or original.


?
 Though none of the great man's descendant s ever came close to achieving whathe had, most of them enjoyed very respectable careers.


Descendant is the opposit e of ancestor. Your grandparent s' descendant s are those who are descended from them-your parent s, your brothers and sist ers, and any children thatany of you may have. It 's been claimed that every person on earth is a descendant of Muhammad, and of every hist orical person before him-Julius Caesar, the Buddha, et c.-who start ed a line o f descent. (Some of us st ill find this hard to believe.) And notall descendant s are human; every modern thesaurus, for example, could be called the descendant of the one devised by Pet er Mark Roget in 1852.
 
==========ascendancy
Governing or controlling int erest ; dominat ion.


?
 China's growing ascendancy over Tibet was capped by the invasion of 1950.


In the course of a year, the sun appears to pass through the t welve const ellat ions of the zodiac in sequence, and all the planet s also lie close to the solar path. The const ellat ion and planet thatare justrising, or ascendant, above the east ern horizon in the sun's path at the moment of a child's birth are said by astrologers to exercise a lifelong controlling influence over the child. This is the idea that lies at the heart of ascendancy, though the word t oday no longer hint s at supernat ural powers.
 
==========ONYM comes from the Greek onyma, meaning "name, word." An anonymous donor or writ er is one who isn't named. A synonym is a word with the same meaning as another word (see SYN). A nd homonyms (see HOM/HOMO) are words that look and sound alike butaren'tact ually relat ed, such as well ("healthy") and well ("a deep hole with wat er in it ").
 
==========ant onym
A word that means the opposit e of some other word.


?
 There's no point in t elling a three-year-old that cat isn'tan ant onym of dog, and sun isn'tan ant onym of moon.


Antonym includes the Greek prefix ant-, meaning "opposit e" (see ANT/ANTI). Ant onyms are oft en thought of in pairs: hot/cold, up/down, wet/dry, buy/sell, failure/success. Buta word may have more than one ant onym (old/young, old/new), especially when one of the words has synonyms (small/large, small/big, little/big), and a word may have many approximat e ant onyms (adore/hate, adore/detest, adore/loathe). Butalthough lot s of words have synonyms, not so many have ant onyms. What would be the ant onym of pink?
 weather?
 semipro?
 thirty?
 firefighter?
 wax?
 about?
 consider?

 
==========eponymous                        Of, relat ing t o, or being the person for whom something is named.


?
 Adject ives such as Elizabethan, Victorian, and Edwardian show how the names of certain Brit ish monarchs have become eponymous for part icular t ime periods and st yles.


Things as differentas a bird, a river, and a drug may be named to honor someone. The Canadian cit y of Vancouver was named aft er the explorer George Vancouver; the diesel engine was named for it s invent or, Rudolph Diesel; Alzheimer's disease was named aft er the physician Alois Alzheimer; and so on. Common eponymous t erms include Ohm's law, Parkinson's Law, and the Peter Principle. And if the Beat les' famous "whit e album" act ually has a name, it 's usually called "The Beat les," which means that it 's eponymous as well. Don't be surprised if eponymous t urns out to be a hard word to use; lot s of other people have discovered the same thing.
 
==========patronymic
     Part of a personal name based on the name of one's father or one of his ancest ors.


?
 Reading Tolst oy's vast novel, it can be helpful to know thathelene Vasilievna's second name is a patronymic, and thus thather father is named Vasili.


A patronymic, or patronym (see also PATER/PATR), is generally formed by adding a prefix or suffix to a name. Thus, a few cent uries ago, the male patronymic of Patrick was Fit zpatrick ("Patrick's son"), that of Pet er was Pet erson or Pet ersen, that of Donald was MacDonald or McDonald, and that of Hernando was Hernndez. Today, of course, each of these is an ordinary family name, or surname. In Russia, both a patronymic and a surname are st ill used; in the name Pet er Ilyich Tchaikovsky, for example, Ilyich is a patronymic meaning "son of Ilya."
 
==========pseudonym                         A name that someone (such as a writ er) uses inst ead of his or her real name.


?
 Hundreds of Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and Bobbsey Twins novels were churned out under such pseudonyms as Franklin W. Dixon, Carolyn Keene, and Laura Lee Hope.


The Greek pseudo- is used in English to mean "false," or somet imes "resembling." A pseudonym is thus a false name, or alias. A writ er's pseudonym is called a pen name, as in the case of Howard O'Brien (who usually writ es as "Anne Rice" but somet imes  under  other names), and an act or's pseudonym is called a stage name, as in the case of Marion Morrison ("John Wayne"). A cadre name may be used for the sake of secrecy by a revolut ionary plot t er such as Vladimir Ulyanov ("Lenin") or Iosif Dzhugashvili ("Stalin"). And in many religious orders, members adopt devotional names, as Agnes Bojaxhiu did in 1931 ("Teresa," lat er known as "Mother Teresa").

==========SCRIB/SCRIP comes from the Latin verb scribere, "t o writ e." Scribble is an old word meaning to writ e or draw carelessly. A writ t en work thathasn't been published is a manuscript. And to describe is to pict ure something in words.
 
==========conscript ion
  Enforced enlist ment  of  persons, especially for military service; draft .


?
 The first comprehensive syst em for nat ionwide conscript ion was inst it ut ed by France for the Napoleonic wars that followed the French Revolut ion.


With it s scrip- root , conscription means basically writ ing someone's name on a list -a list that , unfort unat ely, a lot of people usually don't want to be on. Conscript ion has exist ed at least since ancient Egypt 's Old Kingdom (27th cent ury B.C.), though universal conscript ion has been rare throughouthist ory. Forms of conscript ion were used by Prussia, Swit zerland, Russia, and other European powers in the 17th and 18th cent uries. In the U.S., conscript ion was firstapplied during the Civil War, by both the North and the South. In the North there were pocket s of resistance, and the draft led to riot s in several cit ies. The U.S. abandoned conscript ion at the end of the war and didn'trevive it unt il World War I.
 
==========circumscribe
(1) To clearly limit the range or act ivit y of something. (2) To draw a line around or to surround with a boundary.


?
 Some children do best when their freedom is clearly circumscribed and their act ivit ies are supervised.


The prefix circum-, "around," is the key to circumscribe's basic meaning. Thus, we could say thata boxing ring is circumscribed by ropes, justas the area for an archaeological dig may be. A governor's power is always circumscribed by  a  stat e's  const it ut ion. And  a  physician's assistanthas a circumscribed role that doesn't include writ ing prescript ions.
 
==========inscript ion
     (1)  Something  permanent ly  writ t en, engraved, or  print ed, part icularly on a building, coin, medal, or piece of currency. (2) The dedicat ion of a book or work of art .


?
 All U.S. coins bear the Latin inscript ion "E pluribus unum"-"From many, one."


With it s prefix in-, meaning "in" or "on," it 's not surprising thatan inscript ion is either writ t en on or engraved int o a surface. Inscript ions in the ancient world were always chiseled int o st one, as inscript ions st ill may be t oday. The principal monument of the Viet nam memorial in Washingt on, D.C., for instance, is a black wall on which are inscribed the names of all the Americans who died during the war-each name in full, row upon seemingly endless row. Butan inscript ion may also be a dedicat ion, such as the words "For my wife" all by themselves on a page near the beginning of a book.
 
==========proscribe                         To forbid as harmful or unlawful; prohibit .


?
 Despit e thousands of laws proscribing lit t ering, many of America's street s and public spaces cont inue to be dumping grounds.


The Latin prefix pro- somet imes meant "before," in the sense of "in front of" the people. So in ancientrome proscribere meant to make public in writ ing the name of a person who was about to be execut ed, and whose propert y would be seized by the stat e. But the meaning of the English word soon shift ed to mean simply "prohibit " inst ead. Proscribe t oday is act ually oft en the opposit e of the very similar prescribe, which means basically "require."
 
==========FALL comes from the Latin verb fallere, "t o deceive." It 's act ually at the root of the word false, which we rarely use t oday to mean "decept ive," though that meaning does show up in older phrases: "Thou shalt not bear false wit ness against thy neighbor," for instance, or "A false- heart ed lover will send you to your grave." Fallere is even at the root of fail and fault, though you might not guess it to look at them.
 
==========fallacy                      A wrong belief; a false or mistaken idea.


?
 In her new art icle she exposes yetanother fallacy at the heart of these economic argument s.


Philosophers are constant ly using the word fallacy. For them, a fallacy is reasoning that comes to a conclusion without the evidence to support it . This may have to do with pure logic, with the assumpt ions that the argument is based on, or with the way words are used, especially if they don't keep exact ly the same meaning throughout the argument . There are many classic fallacies that occur again and again through the cent uries and everywhere in the world. You may have heard of such fallacies as the "ad hominem" fallacy, the "quest ion-begging" fallacy, the "straw man" fallacy, the "slippery slope" fallacy, the "gambler's" fallacy, or the "red herring" fallacy. Look them up and see if you've ever been guilt y of any of them.
 
==========fallacious
Containing a mistake; not true or accurat e.


?
 Any policy that 's based on a lot of fallacious assumpt ions is going to be a bad one.


Fallacious is a formal and int ellect ual word. We rarely use it in casual speech; when we do, we risk sounding a bit full of ourselves and all-knowing. But it 's used widely in writ ing, especially when one writ er is arguing with another. And it 's used to describe both errors in factand errors in reasoning, including fallacies of the kind described in the previous entry.
 
==========fallibilit y
     Capabilit y of making mistakes or being wrong.


?
 Doct ors are concerned about the fallibilit y of these t est s, which seem unable to det ect the virus about 20% of the t ime.


You'll find this word showing up in discussions of eyewit ness t est imony at crime scenes, of lie det ect ors, and of crit ical airplane part s. Some of us are most familiar with the fallibilit y of memory, especially when we remember something clearly that t urns out never to have happened. Being fallible is part of being human, and somet imes the biggest errors are made by those who are thought of as the most brilliant of all.
 
==========infallible                       (1) Not capable of being wrong or making mistakes. (2) Certain to work properly or succeed.


?
 Two college friends of mine claimed to have an infallible syst em for beat ing the odds atroulet t e in Las Vegas.


Wat ch out when you hear about infallible predict ions, an infallible plan, an infallible cure, or even infallible lip gloss. Infallible isn'ta claim that scient ist s, engineers, and doct ors like to make, so you're probably get t ing bet t er informat ion when the word not comes first . You may have heard the phrase "papal infallibility," which refers to the official posit ion of the Roman Catholic church, adopt ed in the 19th cent ury, that certain solemn stat ement s made by a Pope about faith or morals were not to be quest ioned. Popes since then have been careful not to make many of these stat ement s.

==========SOLU comes from the Latin verb solvere, "t o loosen, free, release," and the root therefore may take the form solv- as well. So to solve a problem means to find it s solution, as if you were freeing up a logjam. And a solvent is a chemical that dissolves or "loosens up" oil or paint .
 
==========soluble                   (1) Able to be dissolved in a liquid, especially wat er. (2) Able to be solved or explained.


?
 To an opt imist ic young principal, the problems of a school like this one might seem challenging but soluble.


Soluble looks like a word that should be confined to chemistry labs, though it 's oft en used by nonchemist s as well to describe substances that can be dissolved in liquids. On the other hand, the sense of soluble meaning "solvable" is also quit e common. In this sense, soluble, like it s opposit e, insoluble, is usually paired with problem. If only all life's problems were soluble by st irring them in a container filled with wat er.
 
==========absolut ion
  The act of forgiving someone for their sins.


?
 Every week she would kneel to confess her lit t le sins and receive absolut ion from the priest .


Since the Latin absolutus meant "set free," it 's easy to see how absolution came to mean "set free from sin." (And also easy to see why absolute means basically "pure"-that is, originally, "free of sin.") The verb for absolution is absolve. Justas a priestabsolves believers of their sins, you may absolve your brother of blame for a household disast er, or you yourself may in t ime be absolved for that scrape on the car backing out of a parking space.
 
==========dissolut ion                     The act  or process of breaking down or apart  int o basic component s, as through disrupt ion or decay.


?
 The dissolut ion of the U.S.S.R. was probably the most moment ous event of the last quart er of the 20th cent ury.


Dissolution is the noun form of dissolve, but it 's a much less common word. St ill, we refer to the fact that the dissolut ion of American marriages became far more common in the lat er 20th cent ury. Or that when India won it s independence in 1948, the dissolut ion of the once-global Brit ish empire was all but complet e. Or that  fact ors  such  as  crime  and  drugs  might  be contribut ing to the dissolut ion of cont emporary societ y's moral fabric. A dissolute person is someone in whom all restrainthas dissolved, and who now indulges in behavior that shocks decent people.
 
==========resolut e                         Marked by firm det erminat ion.


?
 Aft er t en years of indecision, the Senat e finally seems resolut e aboutreaching an agreement .


Resolute comes from the same Latin verb as resolved, and the two words are oft en synonyms. So how did it get this meaning from the Latin?
 Essent ially, when you resolve a quest ion or problem, you come to a conclusion, and once you've reached a conclusion you can proceed to act . So in your New Year's resolutions, you resolve-or make up your mind-t o do something. Unfort unat ely, New Year's resolut ions aren'ta good illustrat ion of the meaning of resolute, since only about one in t en act ually seems to succeed.
 
==========HYDR flows from the Greek word for "wat er." The "wat er" root  can be found in the lovely flower called the hydrangea: it s seed capsules resemble ancient Greek wat er vessels.
 
==========hydraulic                     (1) Relat ing to wat er; operat ed, moved, or broughtabout by means of wat er. (2) Operat ed by the resistance or pressure of liquid forced through a small opening or t ube.


?
 Withoutany hydraulic engineers, the country is unlikely to build many dams or reservoirs on it s own.


By means of a hydraulic lift , the driver can lift the bed of a dump truck with the t ouch of a but t on. He mightalso repair the hydraulic st eering, the hydraulic brake, or the hydraulic clut ch
-all of which, like the lift thatholds everything up, take advantage of the way liquids act under pressure. Somewhat like a pulley or a lever, a hydraulic syst em magnifies the effect  of moderat e pressure exert ed over a longer distance int o powerful energy for a short er distance.
 
==========dehydrat e
(1) To remove wat er from. (2) To deprive of energy and zest .


?
 The boy appeared at dusk staggering out of the desert , dangerously sunburned and dehydrat ed.


Dehydrat ing food is a good way to preserve it ; raisins, which are dehydrat ed grapes, are a good example. Dehydration through industrial processes makes it possible to keep food even longer and st ore it in a smaller space. Freeze-drying produces food that only needs rehydration-that is, the addit ion of wat er-t o rest ore it s original consist ency. Runners, cyclist s, and hikers fearful of dehydrat ion seem to be constant ly hydrating themselves nowadays, somet imes even using a shoulder pack with a t ube going straight int o the mouth. Dehydrate can also be used for making something "dry" or "lifeless"; thus, a dull t eacher can dehydrat e American hist ory, and an unimaginat ive staging can dehydrat e a great Shakespeare play.
 
==========hydroelectric
  Having to do  with  the  product ion  of  electricit y  by wat erpower.


?
 A massive African hydroelectric project is creat ing the world's largest manmade lake, and is said to hold the key to the fut ure for the country.


The prime component of mosthydroelectric syst ems is a dam. A high dam funnels wat er downward athigh pressure to spin t urbines, which in t urn drive generat ors to produce high- voltage electricit y. Mountainous countries with rushing rivers can produce the mosthydroelectricity. Though hydroelectricit y comes from a clean and complet ely renewable energy source, dams disrupt nat ural syst ems in a way that dist urbs environmentalist s.
 
==========hydroponics                           The growing of plant s in nutrient solut ions, with or without support ing substances such as sand or gravel.


?
 He had never thoughthydroponics produced vegetables as tast y as those grown in soil, and the t omat oes seemed part icularly disappoint ing.


Hydroponics, also known as aquaculture or tank farming, began as  a  way  of  st udying scient ifically the mechanisms of plant nutrit ion. Hydroponically grown plant s may have no solid mat erial under them atall; inst ead, their root s oft en simply hang in wat er with a rich mix of nutrient s dissolved in it . The principal advantage to hydroponics is the savings from reduced labor cost s, since it 's generally carried on in enclosed areas and the irrigat ion and fert ilizing are done mechanically. Peppers, cucumbers, and various other vegetables are produced hydroponically in huge quant it ies.

==========Greek and Latin Borrowings

aegis               (1) Something that prot ect s or defends; shield. (2) Sponsorship or guidance by an individual or organizat ion.


?
 The conference was held under the aegis of the World Affairs Council, which provided almostall of the funding.


The original aegis was a goat skin shield or breast plat e, symbolizing majest y, that was worn by Zeus and his daught er Athena in Greek mythology. Athena's aegis bore the severed head of  the monstrous Medusa. Aegis came to be used for any kind of invulnerable shield. But t oday we almostalways use the word in the phrase "under the aegis of . . . ," which means "under the authorit y, sponsorship, or control of."
 
==========charisma                       (1) An extraordinary gift for leadership thatat tract s popular supportand enthusiasm. (2) A special abilit y to at tract or charm; magnet ism.


?
 Many lat er leaders have envied the charisma of Napoleon Bonapart e, who many of his followers genuinely believed to be immortal.


Charisma is Greek for "gift ," but it s tradit ional meaning comes from Christ ian belief, where it originally referred to an extraordinary power-the gift of healing, the gift of t ongues, or the gift of prophecy-best owed on an individual by the Holy Spirit . The first nonreligious use of charisma didn'tappear unt il the 20th cent ury, when it was applied to that myst erious personal magnet ism thata lucky few seem to possess, especially the magnet ism with which a polit ical leader can arouse great popular enthusiasm. When John F. Kennedy was elect ed president in 1960, it s use by journalist s popularized the t erm in the mass media. Since then, act ors, rock stars, athlet es, generals, and entrepreneurs have all been said to possess charisma.
 
==========ego    (1) A sense  of  confidence  and  sat isfact ion  in  oneself; self-est eem. (2) An exaggerat ed sense of self-importance.


?
 His raging ego was whathis fellow lawyers remembered abouthim-his tantrums, his vanit y, his snobbery, and all the rest of it .


Ego is the Latin word for "I." So if a person seems to begin every sent ence with "I," it 's somet imes a sign of a big ego. It was the psychologist Sigmund Freud (well, act ually his original translat or) who put ego int o the popular vocabulary, but whathe meant by the word is complex, so only other psychologist s really use it in the Freudian sense. The rest of us generally use ego simply to mean one's sense of self-worth, whether exaggerat ed or not . When used in the "exaggerat ed" sense, ego is almost the same thing as conceit. Meet ing a superstar athlet e withouta trace of this kind of ego would be a mostrefreshing experience. Buthaving a reasonable sense of your own worth is no sin. Life's lit t le everyday vict ories are good-in fact , necessary-for a healthy ego.
 
==========ethos             The feat ures, at t it udes, moral code, or basic beliefs that define a person, a group, or an inst it ut ion.


?
 The company's ethos has always been an int erest ing blend of greed and generosit y.


Ethos means "cust om" or "charact er" in Greek. As originally used by Arist ot le, itreferred to a man's charact er or personalit y, especially in it s balance bet ween passion and caut ion. Today ethos is used to refer to the pract ices or values that dist inguish one person, organizat ion, or societ y from others. So we oft en hear of the ethos of rugged individualism and self-sufficiency on the American front ier in the 19th cent ury; and a crit ic might complain about , for example, the ethos of violence in the inner cit ies or the ethos of permissiveness in the suburbs.
 
==========hubris                          Unreasonable or unjust ified pride or self-confidence.


?
 Two hours lat er, the t eam's boast ful pregame hubris bumped int o the embarrassing realit y of defeat .


To the Greeks, hubris referred to extreme pride, especially pride and ambit ion so great that they offend the gods and lead to one's downfall. Hubris was a charact er flaw oft en seen in the heroes of classical Greek tragedy, including Oedipus and Achilles. The familiar old saying "Pride goeth before a fall" is basically talking abouthubris.
 
==========
id  The part of a person's unconscious mind thatrelat es to basic needs and desires.


?
 His own id oft en scared him, especially when a sudden violent impulse would well up out of nowhere.


In Latin, id means simply "it ." Sigmund Freud (and his translat or) brought the word int o the modern vocabulary as the name of what Freud believed to be one of the three basic element s of the human personalit y, the other two being the ego (see ego) and the superego. According to Freud, the id is the first of these to develop, and is the home of the body's basic inst inct s, part icularly those involving sex and aggression. Since the id lacks logic, reason, or even organizat ion, it can contain conflict ing impulses. Primit ive in nat ure, it want s to be sat isfied immediat ely. Although it s workings are complet ely  unconscious,  Freud  believed  that  it s cont ent s could be revealed in works of art , in slips of the t ongue ("Freudian slips"), and in one's dreams.
 
==========libido                  (1) Sexual drive. (2) In psychoanalyt ic theory, energy that is derived from primit ive biological urges and is usually goal-orient ed.


?
 She would sitathome trying not to think about where his unmanageable libido had led him this t ime.


The Latin word libido, meaning "desire, lust ," was borrowed by Sigmund Freud as the name for a concept in his own theories. At firsthe defined libido to mean the  inst inct ual energy associat ed with the sex drive. Lat er he broadened the word's meaning and began using it to mean the mental energy behind purposeful human act ivit y of any kind; in other words, the libido (for which Freud also used the t erm eros, a Greek word meaning "sexual love") came to be regarded as the life inst inct , which included sex along with all the other impulses we rely on to keep us alive. But those of us who aren't psychologist s use the word simply as a synonym for "sex drive."
 
==========trauma            (1) A serious injury to the body. (2) An abnormal psychological stat e caused by mental or emot ional stress or physical injury.


?
 Fift een years lat er, their adopt ed Cambodian daught er was st ill having night mares in which she relived the trauma of those t errible years.


Trauma is the Greek word for "wound." Although the Greeks used the t erm only for physical injuries, nowadays trauma is justas likely to refer to emot ional wounds. We now know thata traumatic event can leave psychological sympt oms long aft er any physical injuries have healed. The psychological react ion to emot ional trauma now has an established name: post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD. It usually occurs aft er an extremely stressful event , such as wart ime combat , a nat ural disast er, or sexual or physical abuse; it s sympt oms include depression, anxiet y, flashbacks, and recurring night mares.

MUR, from the Latin noun murus, meaning "wall," has produced a modest number of English words.
 
==========muralist
 A paint er of wall paint ings.


?
 She's enjoying her new career as a muralist , but it 's t erribly hard on her when she sees her works wrecked by vandals.


Any wall paint ing may be called a mural. Murals have been around since long before the framed paint ing. Scenic murals dat e back to at least 2000 B.C. on the island of Cret e. Indoor murals for privat e homes were popular in ancient Greece and Rome, and many of those at Pompeii were preserved by the lava of Mt . Vesuvius. In the Renaissance the muralist s Raphael and Michelangelo creat ed great wall and ceiling paint ings for the Catholic Church, and Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper became one of the most famous of all murals. Mural paint ing saw a greatrevival in Mexico beginning in the 1920s, when a group of muralist s inspired by the Mexican Revolut ion, including Diego Rivera, J. C. Orozco, and D. A. Siqueiros, began taking their int ensely polit ical art to the public by creat ing giant wall paint ings, somet imes on out door surfaces.
 
==========intramural                        Exist ing or occurring within the bounds of  an inst it ut ion, especially a school.


?
 At college he lacked the t ime to go out for sport s in a serious way, buthe did play intramural hockey all four years.


With it s Latin prefix intra-, "within" (not to be confused with inter-, "bet ween"), intramural means lit erally "within the walls." The word is usually used for sport s played bet ween t eams made up only  from  st udent s  at  one   campus.  Intramural  athlet ics   is   oft en   the   most   popular extracurricular act ivit y ata college or universit y.
 
==========extramural                           Exist ing out side or beyond the walls or boundaries of an organized unit such as a school or hospital.


?
 "Hospital Without Walls" is an extramural program that offers home health-care services.


Extramural contains the Latin extra-, meaning "out side" or "beyond" (see EXTRA). The walls in extramural are usually those of schools, colleges, and universit ies, and the word is oft en seen in phrases like "extramural act ivit ies" and "extramural compet it ion," referring to things  that involve the world beyond the campus. Some inst it ut ions use the t erm "extramural st udy" for what others call "distance learning"-that is, t eaching and learning by means of  Web connect ions to the classroom and to videos of lect ures. Money that flows int o universit ies to supportresearch (from foundat ions, government inst it ut es, et c.) is usually called "extramural income."
 
==========immure                   To enclose within, or as if within, walls; imprison.


?
 In Dumas's famous novel, the Count of Mont e Crist o is in facta sailor who had been unjust ly immured in an island prison for 15 years before breaking outand taking his revenge.


In East ern European legend, whenever a large bridge or fort was complet ed, a young maiden would be immured in the st onework as a sacrifice. (It 's not certain that such things were act ually done.) In Poe's grim st ory "A Cask of Amont illado," a man achieves revenge on a fellow nobleman by chaining him to a cellar wall and bricking him up alive. At the end of Verdi's great opera Aida, Aida joins her lover so that they can die immured t ogether. Butreal-life examples of immurementas a final punishmentare somewhatharder to find.
 
==========POLIS/POLIT comes from the Greek word for "cit y." The ancient Greek cit y-stat es, such as Athens, Thebes, and Sparta, operat ed much like separat e nat ions, so all their politics was local, like all their public policy-and even all their police!
 
==========polit ic                        (1) Cleverly tact ful. (2) Wise in promot ing a plan or plan of act ion.


?
 Anger is rarely a polit ic way to seek agreement , since it usually comes across as rude and self-right eous.


Polit ic behavior in class always requires a respect ful at t it ude t oward your t eacher. It 's never polit ic to ask for a raise when your boss is in a t errible mood. And once t eenagers learn to drive, they quickly learn the polit ic way to ask for the car-that is, what ever get s the keys without upset t ing the parent s. As you can see, politic can be used for many sit uat ions thathave nothing to do with public politics.
 
==========polit icize
 To give a polit ical t one or charact er t o.


?
 By 1968 the Viet nam War had deeply polit icized most of America's college campuses.


Sexual harassment was once seen as a privat e mat t er, but in the 1980s and '90s it became thoroughly polit icized, with women loudly pressuring lawmakers to make it illegal. So, at the same t ime, the issue of sexual harassment polit icized many women, who began to take an int erest in polit ical act ion because of it . In other words, we may speak of an issue becoming polit icized, butalso of a person or group becoming polit icized.
 
==========acropolis
    The high, fort ified part of a cit y, especially an ancient Greek cit y.


?
 On the Athenian Acropolis, high above the rest of the cit y, stands the Parthenon, a t emple to Athena.


The Greek rootacro- means "high"; thus, an acropolis is basically a "high cit y." Ancient cit ies oft en grew up around a high point , in order that they could easily be defended. The Greeks and Romans usually included in their acropolises t emples to the cit y's most important gods; so, for example, Athens builta great t emple on it s Acropolis to it s prot ect or goddess, Athena, from which the cit y t ook it s name. Many lat er European cit ies clust er around a walled cast le on a height , int o which the populat ion of the cit y and the surrounding area could retreat in case of at tack, and even South American cit ies oft en contain a similar walled area on high ground.
 
==========megalopolis (1) A very large cit y. (2) A thickly populat ed area that includes one or more cit ies with the surrounding suburbs.


?
 With it s rapid development , the southern coast  of Florida around Miami quickly became a megalopolis.


A "large cit y" named Megalopolis was founded in Greece in 371 B.C. to help defend the region called Arcadia against  the cit y-stat e of Sparta. Though a stadium seat ing 20,000 was built there, indicat ing the cit y's impressive size for it s t ime, Megalopolis t oday has only about 5,000 people. Social scient ist s now ident ify 10 megalopolises in the U.S., each with more than 10 million people. The one on the east ern seaboard that stret ches from Bost on to Washingt on, D.C., where the densely populat ed cit ies seem to flow int o each other all along the coast , is now home to over 50 million people. But it 's easily surpassed by the Japanese megalopolis that includes Tokyo, with more than 80 million inhabitant s.

==========NUMER comes from the Latin words meaning "number" and "t o count ." A numeral is the symbol thatrepresent s  a  number. Numerous  means  "many,"  and innumerable  means "count less." Numerical superiorit y is superiorit y in numbers, and your numerical standing in a class is a ranking expressed as a number.
 
==========numerology
   The st udy of the occult significance of numbers.


?
 Though he didn't  believe in numerology as a myst ical bond bet ween numbers and living things, he never went out on Friday the 13th.


As an element of astrology and fort une-t elling, numerology has long been employed to predict fut ure event s. For many early Christ ians, 3 represent ed the Trinit y, 6 represent ed earthly perfect ion, and 7 represent ed heavenly perfect ion; and st ill t oday, many of us like to group things int o set s of 3 or 7, for no part icular reason. Numerology has also been used to int erpret personalit y; in part icular, numerologists may assign numbers to each let t er of a person's name and use the result ing figures, along with the person's dat e of birth, as a guide to his or her charact er.
 
==========alphanumeric
    Having or using both let t ers and numbers.


?
 Back in the 1950s, we always spoke our phone numbers in alphanumeric form, using the let t ers print ed on the dial: for example, "TErrace 5-6642," inst ead of "835-6642."


Alphanumeric passwords are much harder for a hacker to crack than plain alphabet ic passwords, since the number of possible combinat ions is so much great er. License plat es usually contain both let t ers and numbers, since, for a big stat e or country, the plat e wouldn't be large enough to fit enough numbers for everyone. In comput ing, the standard alphanumeric codes, such as ASC I, may contain not only ordinary let t ers and numerals butalso punct uat ion marks and math symbols.
 
==========enumerat e To specify one aft er another; list .


?
 The thing he hat ed most was when she would start enumerat ing his fault s out loud, while he would sit scowling int o the newspaper trying to ignore her.


In a census year, the U.S. government  at t empt s to enumerat e every single cit izen of the country-a task that , even in the modern era of t echnology, isn't truly possible. Medical t est s oft en  require  the enumeration  of  bact eria, viruses, or  other  organisms to det ermine  the progress of a disease or the effect iveness of a medicat ion. Despit e it s numer- root , you don'thave to use  numbers  when  enumerat ing.  For  st udent s  of  government   and  law,  the "enumerat ed powers" are the specific responsibilit ies of the Congress, as list ed in the U.S. Const it ut ion; these are the only powers that Congress has, a fact that the Tenth Amendment makes even more clearly.
 
==========supernumerary
               Exceeding the usual number.


?
 Whenever the workload for the cit y's court s and judges get s t oo large, supernumerary judges are called in to help.


Supernumerary start s off with the Latin prefix super-, "above" (see SUPER). You may have heard of someone being born with supernumerary t eeth, supernumerary fingers, or supernumerary t oes. A supernumerary rainbow may show up as a faint line-red, green, or purple-just t ouching the main colored arc. Supernumerary is also a noun: A supernumerary is usually someone in a crowd scene onstage, otherwise known as an "extra" or a "spear-carrier."
 
==========KILO is the French version of the Greek word chilioi, meaning "thousand." France is also where the metric syst em originat ed, in the years following the French Revolut ion. So in English, kilo- shows up chiefly in metric-syst em unit s. Before the comput er age, the most familiar kilo- words for English-speakers were probably kilowatt, meaning "1,000 wat t s," and kilowatt-hour, meaning the amount of energy equal to one kilowat t over the course of an hour.
 
==========kilobyt e                       A unit of comput er informat ion equal to 1,024 byt es.


?
 A 200-word paragraph in the simplest t ext format takes up abouta kilobyt e of st orage space on your hard drive.


Knowing the root kilo-, you might think a kilobyt e would be exact ly 1,000 byt es. Butact ually a kilobyt e represent s the power of 2 that comes closest to 1,000: that is, 210 (2 to the 10th power), or 2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2  2, or 1,024. Why 2?
 Because the capacit y of memory chips is always based on powers of 2. Locat ions in electronic memory circuit s are ident ified by binary numbers (numbers that use only the digit s 0 and 1), so the number of addressable locat ions becomes a power of 2.
 
==========kilomet er
    A unit of length equal to 1,000 met ers.


?
 U.S. highway signs near the Canadian border oft en show distances in kilomet ers in addit ion to miles.


A kilomet er is equal to about 62/100 of a mile, and a mile is equal to about 1.61 kilomet ers. The
U.S. has been slow to adopt metric measures, which are used almost everywhere else in the world. Though our car speedomet ers are oft en marked in both miles and kilomet ers, the U.S. and Great Britain are pract ically the only developed nat ions that st ill show miles rather than kilomet ers on their road signs. But even in the U.S., footraces are usually measured in met ers or kilomet ers, like the Olympic races. Runners normally abbreviat e kilometer to K: "a 5K race" (3.1 miles), "the 10K run" (6.2 miles), and so on.
 
==========kilohert z
 A unit of frequency equal to 1,000 cycles per second.


?
 A drone aircraft nosedived and crashed aft er an onboard tape recorder t urned out to be using a 10-kilohert z signal, the same frequency used by the aircraft 's control syst em.


If  your favorit e AM radio stat ion has a frequency of  680 kilohert z  (kHz), that  means the stat ion's transmit t er is oscillat ing (vibrat ing) ata rat e of 680,000 cycles per  second  (i.e., 680,000 t imes a second). A relat ed t erm is megahertz (MHz), meaning "millions of cycles per second." Short wave radio operat es bet ween 5.9 and 26.1 MHz, and  the  FM  radio  band operat es bet ween 88 and 108 MHz. Garage-door openers work  at  about  40  MHz, baby monit ors work at 49 MHz, and so on. The t erms hertz, kilohertz and megahertz honor the great German physicistheinrich Hert z, the first person to broadcastand receive radio waves.
 
==========kilogram
 A unit of weight equal to 1,000 grams.


?
 The kilogram is the only base unit of measurement st ill defined by a physical objectrather than a physical constant (such as the speed of light ).


The original concept of the kilogram, as the mass of a cubic decimet er of wat er (a bit more than a quart ), was adopt ed as the base unit of mass by the new revolut ionary government of France in 1793. In 1875, in the Treat y of the Met er, 17 countries, including the U.S., adopt ed the French kilogram as an int ernat ional standard. In 1889 a new int ernat ional standard for the kilogram, a metal bar made of plat inum iridium, was agreed t o; President Benjamin Harrison officially received the 1-kilogram cylinder for the U.S. in 1890. But no one uses that bar very oft en; for all pract ical purposes, a kilogram equals 2.2 pounds.

==========MICRO, from the Greek mikros, meaning "small," is a popular English prefix. A microscope let s the eye see microscopic object s, and libraries st ore the pages of old newspapers on microfilm at 1/400th of their original size. And we cont inue to at tach micro- to lot s of familiar words; most of us could figure out  the meaning of microbus  and microquake without  ever having heard them before. Scient ist s oft en use micro- to mean "millionth"; thus, a microsecond is a millionth of a second, and a micrometer is a millionth of a met er.
 
==========microbe         An  organism  (such  as  a  bact erium)  of  microscopic  or  less than microscopic size.


?
 Vaccines reduce  the  risk  of  diseases  by  using  dead  or  great ly  weakened  microbes to st imulat e the immune syst em.


A hint of the Greek word bios, meaning "life," can be seen in microbe. Microbes, or microorganisms, include bact eria, prot ozoa, fungi, algae, amoebas, and slime molds. Many people think of microbes as simply the causes of disease, but every human is act ually the host to billions of microbes, and most of them are essent ial to our life. Much research is now going int o  possible microbial sources of fut ure  energy; algae  looks  part icularly  promising, as  do certain newly discovered or creat ed microbes that can produce cellulose, to be t urned int o ethanol and other biofuels.
 
==========microbiologist
   A scient ist who st udies extremely small forms of life, such as bact eria and viruses.


?
 Food microbiologist s st udy the t iny organisms that cause spoiling and foodborne illness.


Since microorganisms are involved in almost every aspect of life on earth, microbiologist s work across a broad range of subjectareas. Some st udy only viruses, some only bact eria. A marine microbiologist st udies the roles of microbial communit ies in the sea. A soil microbiologist might focus on the use and spread of nitrogen. Vet erinary microbiologist s mightresearch bact eria thatat tack racehorses or diagnose anthrax in cows. And the government put s microbiologist s to work st udying whether microbes could adapt to life on the surface of Mars, and how to defend ourselves against the possibilit y of germ warfare.
 
==========microbrew
 A beer made by a brewery that makes beer in small amount s.


?
 As a cit y of 75,000 people with eight breweries, it offers a great er variet y of microbrews per capita than any other place in America.


Microbrews are usually beers or ales made with special malt s  and  hops, unfilt ered  and unpast eurized, and thus dist inct ive in their aroma and flavor. Many microbreweries double as bar/restaurant s, called brewpubs, where the gleaming vat s  may  be  visible  behind  a  glass part it ion. "Craft brewing" and the opening of local brewpubs began in earnest in the U.S. in the 1980s. But not everyone is willing to pay extra for a beer, and lot s of people are simply used to the blander tast e of the best -selling beers, so by 2008 microbrews st ill only account ed for about 4% of all beer sold in the U.S.
 
==========microclimat e
    The essent ially uniform local climat e of a small sit e or habitat .


?
 Temperat ure, light , wind speed, and moist ure are the essent ial component s of a microclimat e.


The microclimat e of an industrial park may be quit e different from that of a nearby wooded park, since the plant s absorb light  and heat while asphalt  parking lot s and rooft ops radiat e them back int o the air. A microclimat e can offer a small growing area for crops that wouldn't do well in the wider region, so skilled gardeners take advantage of microclimat es by carefully choosing and posit ioning their plant s. San Francisco's hills, oceanfront , and bay shore, along with it s alt ernat ing areas of concret e and greenery, make ita cit y of microclimat es.
 
==========MULTI comes from the Latin word multus, meaning "many." Thus, a multicultural societ y is one that includes people  of  several  different  countries, languages, and  religions; a multimedia art work uses two or more art ist ic media (dance, music, film, spoken t ext , et c.); and a multitude of complaint s reaching your office would be a great many indeed.
 
==========mult icellular
       Consist ing of many cells.


?
 Mult icellular organisms-fungi, plant s, and animals-have specialized cells that perform different funct ions.


Mult icellular organisms are dist inguished from the  very  primit ive  single-celled  organisms- bact eria, algae, amoebas, et c. Even sponges, simple as they are, have specialized cell t ypes such as digest ive cells. In complex mult icellular organisms, only the surface cells can exchange substances with the ext ernal environment ,  so  the  organisms  have  developed  transport syst ems such as the circulat ory syst em, in which the blood brings gases and nutrient s to the cells and removes wast e product s from them.
 
==========mult idisciplinary
                    Involving two or more subjectareas.


?
 Her favorit e class was Opera, a mult idisciplinary class taught joint ly by a music professor and a lit erat ure professor.


A discipline is a field of st udy. So a mult idisciplinary (or interdisciplinary) course is a t eam- taught course in which st udent s are asked to understand a single subjectas it 's seen by two or more tradit ional disciplines. Mult idisciplinary t eaching can open st udent s' eyes to different views of a subject that they had never considered before. A mult idisciplinary panel discussion, on the other hand, present s views from scholars in different fields but may leave any merging of the informat ion to the audience.
 
==========mult ifarious
    Having or occurring in great variet y; diverse.


?
 Nat ives put the coconut palm to mult ifarious uses: using the nut s for eat ing, the juice for drinking, the wood for building hut s, the leaves for that ch, the fiber for mat s, and the shells for ut ensils.


Multifarious is a rather grand word, probably not for everyday use, but when you want to emphasize great variet y-such as the huge number of uses to which a stat e-of-the-art cell phone can be put -it can be  effect ive. Dict ionary  fans  are  constant ly  amazed  by  the mult ifarious meanings of the word set (47 of them in one unabridged dict ionary), and thesaurus lovers may marvel at the mult ifarious synonyms for drunk.
 
==========mult ilat eral
    Involving more than two nat ions or part ies.


?
 A couple of t imes a year, representat ives of the large industrial democracies meet for a round of mult ilat eral trade negot iat ions.


Sin ce lateral means "side" (see LATER) , multilateral means basically "many-sided." The philosophy of multilateralism claims that the best solut ions generally result when as many of the  world's nat ions as possible  are  involved  in  discussions, and multilateralists oft en favor strengthening the Unit ed Nat ions. Today mult ilat eralism can be seen at work in, for example, the World Health Organizat ion, the World Trade Organizat ion, and the Int ernat ional Criminal Court . But the U.S. doesn'talways join the major mult ilat eral organizat ions, inst ead oft en behaving as if a unilateral approach-that is, going italone-was best for the int erest s of a powerful nat ion.

==========PAR, from the Latin, means "equal." Our English word par means an amount taken as an average or a standard, and especially the standard score for each hole on a golf course- which is why the phrase "par for the course" means "aboutas well as expect ed." We compare things to see if they're equal; similar things can be called comparable-that is, "equal with." And "on a par with" means "comparable t o."
 
==========parit y                       The stat e of being equal.


?
 That year the Canadian dollar reached parit y with the U.S. dollar for the first t ime in three decades.


Parity has special meanings in such fields as physics, math, medicine, genet ics, and market ing. Back when the Soviet Union and the U.S. were opposing superpowers, there was oft en talk of parit y in nuclear weapons bet ween the two sides. We somet imes hear about parit y bet ween mental and physical health in insurance coverage, or parit y in colleges' funding of men's and women's athlet ics. But parit y may be most common in discussions of currencies. The exchange rate bet ween two nat ional currencies oft en changes every day, as each drift s higher or lower, and occasionally two similar currencies, such as the euro and the U.S. dollar, will achieve parit y, but itrarely last s long.
 
==========disparit y
   A not iceable and oft en unfair difference bet ween people or things.


?
 He'd been not icing an increasing disparit y bet ween what the government was claiming and whathe saw happening all around him.


Disparity contains the Latin dis, meaning "apart " or "non-" (see DIS), so a disparit y is a kind of "nonequalit y." The word is oft en used to describe a social or economic condit ion that 's considered unfairly unequal: a racial disparit y in hiring, a health disparit y bet ween the rich and the poor, an income disparit y bet ween men and women, and so on. It s adject ive, disparate (accent ed on the first syllable), is oft en used to emphasize strong differences.
 
==========nonpareil
  Someone or something of unequaled excellence.


?
 Crit ics seem to agree that this is the new nonpareil of video-game consoles, the one to beat .


American children learn this word (even if they can't pronounce it ) as the name of the candies covered with whit e sugar pellet s that they buy at the movie theat er, and it 's also the name of  the pellet s themselves. But the more general meaning is common t oo. Nonpareil is also an adject ive. A famous boxing champion of the 1920s was known as Nonpareil Jack Dempsey, when he wasn't being called "the Manassa Mauler." Like it s synonyms paragon and peerless, nonpareil is popular as a company and product name; it 's also the name of a fruit , an almond, a bird, and a but t erfly.
 
==========subpar                        Below a usual or normal level.


?
 Because of a severe cold, her performance that evening had been subpar, but the audience seemed to love itanyway.


Since sub- means "below" (see SUB), almostanything that fails to measure up to a tradit ional standard may be called subpar. So you may hear of subpar rat ings for a TV show, subpar care ata nursing home, subpar at t endance ata concert , or subpar work by a contract or. If you played a subpar round of golf, though, you needed more strokes than you should have.
 
==========PHOB comes from the Greek noun phobos, "fear," and it shows up clearly in our noun phobia, meaning "unusual fear of a specific thing." Phobias vary great ly in seriousness and also in frequency. Most of us have experienced claustrophobia at some t ime, but few truly suffer from fear of the number 13, a condit ion known as triskaidekaphobia.
 
==========acrophobic
    Fearful of height s.


?
 She's so acrophobic that , whenever she can'tavoid taking the rout e that includes the high bridge, she asks the police to drive her across.


The Greek akron means "height " or "summit ," and the acro- root can be seen in such words as acrobatand Acropolis. Almost everyone has some fear of height s, butan abnormal dread of high places, along with the vert igo (dizziness) that mostacrophobes also experience, are common as well; in fact , acrophobia is one of the half-dozen most common recognized phobias. Acrophobia and claustrophobia both play a role in another well-known phobia: the fear of flying, it self oft en known as aerophobia.
 
==========agoraphobia
       A  fear  of  being  in  embarrassing  or  inescapable sit uat ions, especially in open or public places.


?
 Aft er barely surviving a t errible at tack of agoraphobia in the middle of the Sonoran Desert , he finally agree to start seeing a psychologist .


The agora was the market place in ancient Greece; thus, agoraphobia oft en involves fear of public places and crowds. But italso may involve fear of being in shops, or even fear of being in open spaces, or fear of traveling alone. It may also  be  a  fear  of  experiencing  some uncontrollable or embarrassing event (like faint ing) in the presence of others with no help available. Agoraphobia can be hard to understand for those who don't suffer from it , especially because it can take so many different forms, but it is oft en a serious and socially crippling condit ion.
 
==========xenophobe
One who has a fear or hatred of strangers or foreigners.


?
 A Middle East erner reading the U.S.'s visa restrict ions might feel that the Stat e Depart ment was run by xenophobes.


Xenophobe is part ly based on the Greek noun xenos, meaning "stranger, guest , foreigner." Unlike other phobias, xenophobia isn'treally considered an abnormal condit ion; inst ead, it 's generally thought of as just serious narrow-mindedness, the kind of thinking that goes along with racism and extreme patriot ism. In t imes of war, a government will oft en act ually try to t urn all it s cit izens int o xenophobes.
 
==========arachnophobia
        Having a fear or dislike of spiders.


?
 At 50, my sist er st ill suffers from arachnophobia, and can't sleep in a room unless she knows ithas no spiders.


In Greek mythology, Arachne was a weaver of such skill that she dared to challenge the goddess Athena ather craft . When she won their compet it ion by weaving a tapestry disrespect ful to the gods, the enraged Athena t ore it to shreds, and in despair Arachne hanged herself. Out of pit y, Athena loosened the rope, which became a cobweb, and changed Arachne int o a spider. Today, the spiders, scorpions, mit es, and t icks all belong to the class known as arachnids. Arachnophobia is the most common of the animal phobias; but many people suffer from similar phobias regarding snakes (ophidiophobia), dogs (cynophobia), and mice and rat s (musophobia).

==========Medical Words

HEM/HEMO comes from the Greek word for "blood" and is found at the beginning of many medical t erms. By dropping the h-, the same word produced the suffix -emia, which likewise shows up in lot s of "blood" words, including anemia, leukemia and hyperglycemia.
 
==========hemorrhage             (1) A large  loss  of  blood  from  a  blood  vessel. (2) A rapid  and uncontrollable loss or out flow.


?
 He arrived at the emergency room report ing headache, nausea, and drowsiness, and the doct or immediat ely suspect ed thathe'd suffered a brain hemorrhage.


A hemorrhage usually result s from either a severe blow to the body or from medicat ion being taken for something else. Though many hemorrhages aren't part icularly serious, those that occur in the brain (cerebral hemorrhages) can be life-threat ening. In older people, hemorrhages are oft en caused by blood-thinning medicat ion taken to preventheartat tacks. A bruise (or hematoma) is a hemorrhage close enough to the surface of the skin to be visible. Hemorrhage is also a verb, which isn'talways used to talk aboutact ual blood; thus, we may hear thata business is hemorrhaging money, or that the U.S. has been hemorrhaging industrial jobs for decades. Be careful when writ ing hemorrhage; it 's notan easy word to spell.
 
==========hemat ology
   The st udy of blood and blood-forming organs.


?
 Her specialt y in hemat ology lether work with pat ient s of all ages and t ypes, since blood problems may affectalmostanyone.


Blood is basic to almostall the body's funct ions, and a blood t est can reveal more about your physical condit ion than almostany other kind of examinat ion, so hemat ology is an important medical specialt y, with many separat e subject s. Since blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, the bones are one important focus for hematologists. The coagulat ion, or thickening, of the blood is another important subject , since coagulat ion is what keeps us from bleeding to death from even small wounds. And there are dozens of serious blood diseases, including anemia (a lack of red blood cells) and leukemia (cancer involving a buildup of whit e blood cells).
 
==========hemophilia A  bleeding  disorder  caused  by  the  blood's  inabilit y to coagulat e.

 When he was a child, his hemophilia had kepthim from joining the other kids in rough play atrecess.


The dreaded disease known as hemophilia is the result  of  an inherit ed gene, and almostalways strikes boys rather than girls (though mothers may pass the gene to their sons). Since the blood lacks an ingredient that causes it to clot or coagulat e when a blood vessel breaks, even a minor wound can cause a hemophiliac to bleed to death if not treat ed. Bleeding can be part icularly dangerous when it 's ent irely int ernal, with no visible wound, since the person may not be aware it 's happening. Queen Vict oria transmit t ed the hemophilia gene to royal families all across Europe; the hemophilia of a young Russian prince played a part in the downfall of the Russian  czars.  Today,  hemophiliacs  take  drugs  that st op  the  bleeding  by  speeding coagulat ion, and hemophiliac life expectancies in developed countries are almostas long as the average.
 
==========hemoglobin
      The element  in blood that  transport s oxygen from the lungs to the body's t issues and transport s carbon dioxide from the t issues back to the lungs.


?
 Her doct or had not iced her low hemoglobin countand was insist ing that she include more iron-rich vegetables in her diet .


When filled with oxygen, the hemoglobin in your blood is brightred; ret urning to the lungs without it s oxygen, it loses it s bright ness and becomes somewhat bluish. Hemoglobin levels can change from day to day, and may be affect ed by such fact ors as a lack of iron in the diet , a recent loss of blood, and being pregnant . When you give blood, a nurse first pricks your finger to t est your hemoglobin level; a low hemoglobin count indicat es anemia and may mean that you shouldn't give blood that day. Mild anemia is generally of lit t le importance, but some t ypes can be very serious.
 
==========ITIS, a suffix found in both Greek and Latin, means "disease" or "inflammat ion." In appendicitis your appendix is swollen and painful, and in tonsillitis the same is true of your t onsils. With laryngitis, your throatand larynx may become so sore that it 's difficult to talk. Some of us enjoy making up our own -itis words; high-school t eachers, for example, long ago not iced that many of their seniors t ended to lose all int erest in schoolwork and start skipping classes, and labeled the condit ion senioritis.
 
==========bursit is                  Inflammat ion of a lubricat ing sac (bursa), especially of the shoulder or elbow.


?
 My barber developed bursit is aft er many years of lift ing his arms all day.


A bursa is a lit t le pouch filled with fluid that sit s bet ween a t endon and a bone. When the fluid becomes infect ed by bact eria or irritat ed by t oo much movement , bursit is result s. Throwing a baseball t oo many t imes at one session, for example, may inflame and irritat e one of the bursae (not ice the plural form) in the shoulder. Bursit is in another part of the body may be known by a tradit ional name such as "housemaid's knee," "soldier's heel," or "t ennis elbow." Bursit is generally goes away aft er a few weeks of rest ing the affect ed area, and the pain can be treat ed with ice packs and aspirin.
 
==========hepat it is
    Inflammat ion of the liver.


?
 His skin now had a yellowish t inge, as did the whit es of his eyes, and his doct or immediat ely recognized the signs of advanced hepat it is.


The liver, the body's largest gland, performs many important tasks, but is also vulnerable to many illnesses. At least five t ypes of hepat it is, labeled with the let t ers A-E, are caused by viruses. The most common are hepat it is A, acquired through contaminat ed food and wat er; hepat it is B, which usually travels via sexual act ivit y or shared needles; and hepat it is C, generally passed through shared needles. Some other t ypes, including alcoholic hepat it is (caused by drinking t oo much alcohol), aren't infect ious. There are vaccines for t ypes A and B, and drug treat ment s for A, B, and C, though the drugs aren'talways effect ive.
 
==========bronchit is
 Inflammat ion of the bronchial t ubes.


?
 Before the smoking ban went int o effect , three flightat t endant s had sued the airline, claiming secondhand smoke was to blame for their bronchit is.


The bronchial t ubes carry air int o the t iny branches and smaller cells of the lungs. In bronchit is, the t ubes become sore and you develop a deep cough. Bronchit is caused by bact eria can be treat ed with ant ibiot ics, but there's no drug treat ment for the more common kind caused by a virus. A bout of bronchit is may involve  a couple of weeks of coughing (with no laughing allowed), weakness, and loss of energy and int erest in doing things. Apart from that , bronchit is is rarely serious-at least if it doesn't progress to pneumonia.
 
==========t endinit is                      A painful condit ion in which a t endon in the arm or leg becomes inflamed.


?
 Aft er years of t ennis and bicycling, she now has t endinit is of both the elbow and the knee.


Tendinit is is oft en seen in act ive, healthy people who do something that  requires repeat ed mot ion, including golfers and t ennis players (especially those with improper form), carpent ers, and violinist s. It 's usually treat ed by keeping the joint from moving, by means of a splint , cast , or bandage. If  not  dealt  with in t ime, t endinit is can t urn int o the more serious tendinosis, or t endon degenerat ion.

NANO SUPER DE NUL/NULL ARM SURG STRAT LATER TOM IATR
Quiz27-1 Quiz27-2 Quiz27-3 Quiz27-4 Quiz27-5 ReviewQuizzes27

NANO comes from the Greek nanos, meaning "dwarf." For a prefix meaning "small," English got by for cent uries with the Greek micro-, and lat er mini- came to be used widely as well. But only recent ly, as a result of advances in scient ific knowledge and t echnology, has there been a need for a prefix meaning "extremely small"-a need that 's been filled by nano-, which t oday is being at tached to all kinds of words, somet imes not very seriously (nanoskirt, nano-brained, et c.).
 
==========nanot echnology
           The science of  manipulat ing mat erials on an at omic or molecular scale, especially to build microscopic devices such as robot s.


?
 Nanot echnology is now seen as contribut ing to numerous environmental solut ions, from cleaning up hazardous wast e sit es to producing strong but light weight mat erials for aut o bodies.


Nanot echnology, or nanotech for short , deals with mat t er ata level that most of us find hard to imagine, since it involves object s with dimensions of 100 billionths of a met er (1/800th of the thickness of a human hair) or less. The chemical and physical propert ies of mat erials oft en change great ly at this scale. Nanot echnology is already being used in aut omobile t ires, land- mine det ect ors, and comput er disk drives. Nanomedicine is a part icularly excit ing field: Imagine part icles the size of a blood cell that could be released int o the bloodstream to form int o t iny robot s and at tack cancer cells, or "machines" the size of a molecule that could act ually repair the damaged int eriors of individual cells.
 
==========nanosecond
    One billionth of a second.


?
 When he finally asked if she would marry him, it t ook her abouta nanosecond to say yes.


The nonserious use of nanosecond is probably much more common than the proper t echnical use. In measurement t erms such as nanosecond, nanogram, and nanometer, nano- means "billionth"; in other kinds of words, it s meaning isn't quit e so precise. In comput ers, the speed of reading and writ ing to random access memory (RAM) is measured in nanoseconds. By comparison, the speed of reading or writ ing to a hard drive or a CD-ROM player, or for informat ion to travel over the Int ernet , is measured in milliseconds (thousandths of a second), which are a million t imes longer than nanoseconds.
 
==========nanostruct ure
  An arrangement , struct ure, or part of something of molecular dimensions.


?
 In the 1990s the physics depart ment , which had been doing  ext ensive  research  on microstruct ures, began to get deeply involved in nanostruct ures, including nanofoam, nanoflakes, and nanofibers.


Two important t ypes of nanostruct ure are nanocrystals (t iny crystals, oft en of semiconduct ing mat erial) and nanotubes (t iny t ubes, usually of pure carbon). Nanocrystals made from semiconduct ors change color depending on their size, and are being used for such tasks as det ect ing viruses in living cells. Nanot ubes can conduct enormous amount s of  electrical current , far more than metal wires. They are the basic mat erial of t iny "paper" bat t eries, which can be rolled, folded, or cut while st ill producing power. Nanot ubes are also now being used in mat erials for light weight t ennis racket s and golf clubs, and may soon enable the manufact ure of TV screens no thicker than a film.
 
==========nanopart icle
  A t iny part icle whose size is measured in billionths of a met er.


?
 Nanopart icles of iron are being used to clean up soil pollut ion, helping break down molecules of dangerous substances int o simple compounds.


Nanopart icles of a mat erial usually have very different qualit ies from those that the mat erial has at it s ordinary scale, which is one reason why there's such excit ement  about  the possibilit ies for how they might be used in fut ure t echnologies. Many uses have already been developed. Aluminum nanopart icles added to rocket fuel can make the fuel burn t wice as fastand release much more energy. Silicon nanopart icles are increasing the energy efficiency of solar cells by allowing the energy from ultraviolet light to be capt ured for the first t ime. Other nanopart icles are now helping preventrust in metals, produce stronger bat t eries, enhance the diagnosis of cancer, and improve the filt ering of wat er, and the number of other applicat ions is growing fast .
 
==========SUPER, a Latin prefix meaning "over, higher, more than," has become one of the most familiar prefixes in English, one of those prefixes that we use to creat e new words all the t ime: supermodel, superpowerful, superjock, supersize, supersweet-the list goes on and on. This all seems to have start ed in 1903 when the playwright G. B. Shaw translat ed the German word bermensch, Niet zsche's famous t erm for the person who rises to heroic height s through discipline and creat ive power, in the t it le of his play Man and Superman. The comic-book charact er with the same name wouldn't make his appearance for another 30 years.
 
==========superfluous
      Beyond what is needed; extra.


?
 My Freshman Comp professor removes all superfluous words from our essays, and usually ends up short ening mine by about 40 percent .


Since the Latin fluere means "t o flow" (see FLU), you can think of superfluous as describing a river with so much wat er that it 's overflowing it s banks. The word is used in all kinds of cont ext s. Superfluous charact ers in comput er code may keep it from working. Most of the but t ons on a remot e control may strike us as superfluous, since we never use them. When a sit uat ion "speaks for it self," any comment may be superfluous. And whenever you yourself are feeling superfluous, as in a "Two's company, three's a crowd" sit uat ion, it 's probably t ime to leave.
 
==========insuperable
   Incapable of being solved or overcome.


?
 In learning to speak again aft er suffering a massive stroke, he had overcome what seemed like insuperable odds.


From it s root s, the lit eral meaning of insuperable would be something like "un-get -overable"; insurmountable is a fairly exact synonym. Insuperable is used to describe obstacles, difficult ies, barriers, obstruct ions, problems, and object ions. Americans love st ories of people who succeed in spit e of t errible handicaps, whether as a result of physical limitat ions, prejudice, povert y, or lack of opport unit y; such rugged spirit s may be called indomitable, "incapable of being subdued."
 
==========supersede                      To take the place of; to replace with something newer or more useful.


?
 The not orious decision in the Dred Scot t case was superseded by the 14th Amendment to the Const it ut ion, which stat ed thatanyone born in the U.S. had all the right s of a cit izen.


The Latin word supersedere means "sit on t op of"-which is one way of taking someone else's place. Your boss may send around a memo that supersedes the memo she sent the day before (the one with all the errors in it ). Every t ime the first -class postage rat e goes up, the new stamps supersede the old ones. In science, a new theory oft en supersedes an older one; for example, the theory thata charact erist ic you acquire during your lifet ime can be passed on biologically to your children (called Lamarckism) was superseded by  Darwin's  theory  of evolut ion. Wat ch out  when spelling this word; supersede is pract ically the only English word that ends in -sede.
 
==========superlat ive
    Supreme, excellent .


?
 The new restaurant t urned out to be an elegant place, and we all agreed that the food and wine were superlat ive.


Superlative may sound high-flown when compared with a synonym like outstanding, but if your next paper comes back from your t eacher with the comment "Superlat ive work!" at the t op you probably won't complain. Since superlative means "best , great est ," it makes sense that superlative is also a t erm used in grammar for the highest degree of comparison. So for the adject ive simple, for example, the comparat ive form is simpler and the superlat ive form is simplest; and for the adverb boldly, the comparat ive form is more boldly and the superlat ive is most boldly.

Answers
 
==========DE in Latin means "down, away." So a descent is a downward slope or climb, and a decline is a downward slide (of health, income, et c.). To devalue something is to take value away from it . And you might describe a depressed friend as "down."
 
==========debase                   To lower the value or reputat ion of someone or something.


?
 Every year she complains abouthow Christ mas has been debased by commercialism.


Debase is oft en used to talk about  someone's  lowered  stat us  or  charact er. People  are constant ly blust ering about the debased tast es of the ordinary American, and especially the debased music of America's youth. A commentat or might observe that both candidat es had managed to debase themselves by the end of a polit ical campaign. Debase has a special meaning in economics: From t ime to t ime, government s find that they need to quiet ly debase their countries' currency by reducing the percentage of valuable metal in it s coins; if they don't , the metal may become more valuable than the coin and people will begin melt ing the coins down and reselling the metal.
 
==========defamat ion
     The harming of someone's reputat ion by libel or slander.


?
 In a famous case in 1735, the newspaper publisher J. P. Zenger was found not guilt y of defamat ion because everything he had print ed about the plaint iff was true.


Harming someone's reputat ion in speech with falsehoods is known as slander, and doing the same thing in writ ing is known as libel (which somet imes includes speech as well). Any ordinary cit izen who can claim to have suffered harm as a result of such defamat ion may sue. So why aren't polit icians suing all the t ime?
 Because an except ion is made for "public persons" (a cat egory that includes most  other celebrit ies as well), who must  also prove that  any such stat ement  was made with  "reckless disregard  for the  truth." And although, even  by that standard, public persons are defamed all the t ime, most of them have decided that it 's bet t er to just grin and bear it .
 
==========degenerat ive Causing the body or part of the body to become weaker or less able to funct ion as t ime passes.


?
 Alzheimer's is a degenerat ive disease of the brain, marked by the decline of mental and physical abilit ies.


Degenerat ive  diseases-including  cancer,  glaucoma,  Parkinson's,  diabet es,  arthrit is,  and leprosy-are usually contrast ed with infect ious diseases (diseases caused by bact eria, viruses, fungi, and prot ozoa). However, many infect ious diseases (Lyme disease, AIDS, et c.) can cause a body or body part to degenerate, and infect ive organisms play a part in some degenerat ive diseases. Some degenerat ive diseases can be controlled; some can even be cured. But no one has  yet  discovered  a  way to reverse  such  degenerat ive  condit ions  as  mult iple  sclerosis, emphysema, or Alzheimer's.
 
==========deject ion
  Sadness, depression, or lowness of spirit s.


?
 Her friends were puzzled by her frequent periods of deject ion, which seemed to occur with no obvious cause.


Based part ly on the Latin iacere, "t o throw" (see JECT), dejection means lit erally "cast down"- that is, "downcast ." Like melancholy, gloom, and even sadness, dejection seems to have been declining in use for many years; inst ead, we now seem to prefer depression (whose root s mean basically "a pressing down"). Since depression is also the word used by doct ors, lot s of people now assume thatanyone depressed should be taking an ant idepressant ; if we went back to dejected and dejection, we might not be so quick to make thatassumpt ion.
 
==========NUL/NULL comes from the Latin word nullus, "none," which is it self  a  combinat ion  of ne- ("not ") and ullus ("any"). Have you ever not iced how many of our negat ive words start with n-?
 Think of no, not, never, nothing, none, no one, nowhere, and the hundreds of non- words-justaboutall of which go back to the same Greek root .
 
==========null            (1) Having no legal power; invalid. (2) Having no element s.


?
 If we can prove that you signed the contract because you were being physically threat ened, it will aut omat ically be declared null.


Null is used most ly by lawyers, mathemat icians, and comput er programmers. In law, it usually occurs in the phrase "null and void" (which means about the same thing as null it self). When one of the part ies thathas signed a contract doesn'thold up his or her part of the deal-for example, if a contract stat es thata supplier must supply a million screws of a certain qualit y of st eel, and it t urns out the screws supplied were of inferior st eel-the other company can refuse to pay anything, claiming the contract is null and void. In mathemat ics, null means "lacking any element s"; a null set is a set of figures that 's act ually empt y. In comput er programming, a null is a charact er that doesn'tact ually show up as a charact er, but inst ead may just be required to show thata series of digit s or charact ers is finished.
 
==========nullit y                      (1) Nothingness. (2) A mere nothing.


?
 He couldn't believe she'd act ually lefthim for that nullit y-a guy with no st yle, no drive, no personalit y atall.


Int ellect uals may speak of a book or a film as a nullit y, claiming it possesses nothing original enough to just ify it s exist ence. Legal scholars also use the word; a law passed by a legislat ure may be called a nullit y if, for example, it 's so obviously unconst it ut ional that it 's going to be shot down by the court s in no t ime. And if you're in an unkind mood, you're also free to call a person a nullit y, if you're not inst ead calling him a nobody, a nonent it y, or a zero.
 
==========nullify               (1) To cancel legally. (2) To cause something to lose it s value or to have no effect .


?
 In soccer or wat er polo, a penalt y can nullify a goal thathas just been made.


A legislat ure may nullify a ban, a law, or a tax by simply passing a new law. Elect ion result s can be nullified if a court finds the vot ing process was improper, and a courtruling can be nullified by a higher court . Even the Supreme Court it self may have it s decisions nullified by new laws passed by the Congress-though not if a decision is based on the Const it ut ion. In the years leading up to the American Civil War, Southern stat es claimed the right to nullify any federal law (such as ant islavery laws) that they believed to be unconst it ut ional, leading to the Nullification Crisis of 1832. Annul is a close synonym of nullify (with the same root ), as are abrogate and invalidate.
 
==========annulment
  An official stat ement that something is no longer valid.


?
 He request ed an annulment of the marriage from the Church, buthis wife claimed that , aft er 15 years and two children, the idea of annulment was ridiculous.


Annulment usually applies to marriage. In some stat es an annulment may be carried out by a court ("judicial annulment "), butannulment is generally pract iced by a church ("ecclesiast ic annulment "), and principally the Roman Catholic Church, which tradit ionally hasn't  permit t ed divorce. The usual acceptable reason for annulment is a "failure to consummat e" the marriage by having children. Unlike a marriage that ends in divorce, an annulled marriage is considered never to have exist ed. Other things can be annulled as well, including a contract (if one part y fails to comply with it s t erms) or an elect ion (if it wasn't carried out properly).

==========ARM comes from the Latin arma, meaning "weapons, t ools." The root is seen in such English words as arms (i.e., weapons), armed, and army. Ithas nothing to do with the limb that start s at your shoulder; the name for that kind of arm comes from the Latin word meaning "shoulder."
 
==========armada                          A large group of warships or boat s.


?
 The U.S. Navy hopes to build an electric armada, a new generat ion of ships driven by electric power.


A Spanish word that originally meant simply "armed," armada is now used in Spanish-speaking nat ions as the name of their nat ional  navies. In  English, the  word  usually  has  hist orical overt ones. The Greatarmada of 1588 was a 120-ship fleet  sent by Philip  I of Spain in an at t empt to invade Elizabethan England; it was defeat ed when Brit ish forces lit eight ships afire and sent them sailing int o the Armada's midst , then blocked the passage to the south so that  the remaining ships were forced to sail northward around Britain in order to ret urn home, causing dozens more ships to be wrecked in the st ormy northern seas. Today we somet imes use the word humorously for fleet s of fishing boat s, rowboat s, or canoes.
 
==========armist ice
  An agreement to st op fight ing a war; a truce.


?
 Ambassadors from three neighboring countries were trying to arrange an armist ice bet ween the warring forces.


Justas the solstice is the t ime of year when the sun (Latin, sol) "stands st ill," an armist ice is an agreement for armies to st op where they are and lay down their arms. The word is associat ed with the truce that marked the end of World War I on the West ern Front , where the Allies had confront ed Germany, in 1918. The day of the ceasefire, November 11th ("the eleventh day of the eleventh month"), was for many years called Armist ice Day; t oday it 's known as Vet erans Day in the U.S. and as Remembrance Day in Canada and Australia.
 
==========armory                    A place where weapons are made or st ored.


?
 The great military rifles known as the Springfield 30.06 and the M1 were developed at the Springfield Armory in Massachuset t s.


An armory has tradit ionally been a military st orage compound where machine guns, rifles, pist ols, ammunit ion, part s, and accessories are kept . In the U.S., Nat ional Guard and Reserve unit s oft en use armories as training headquart ers in peacet ime. Ever since George Washingt on established the country's firstarmory in Springfield in 1777, arsenals and armories of the Army Ordnance Corps have had a remarkable hist ory of arms manufact ure.
 
==========disarming
Tending to remove any feelings of unfriendliness or distrust .


?
 All of  us at the meet ing were charmed by the new manager's disarming openness and modest y.


A defeat ed country is somet imes forced to disarm (give up it s weapons), and research may be aimed at disarming a deadly virus (making it incapable of doing damage). But the meaning of the adject ive disarming isn't quit e so physical. If you say your nephew has a disarming smile, you mean thathis smile's warmth and genuineness disarm the people he meet s  of  any possible suspicion or crit icism and of any verbal weapons they mighthave used againsthim.
 
==========SURG comes from the Latin verb surgere, meaning "t o rise, spring up." Our noun surge means "a sudden, large increase," and the verb surge means "t o move with a surge." A storm surge occurs when violent st orm winds at sea cause the wat er to pile up higher than normal sea level. A surge protector keeps a spike in electrical current from "frying" your comput er when a light ning strike sends a sudden surge down the wires.
 
==========upsurge                      A rapid or sudden increase or rise.


?
 Almost forgot t en for years, at 76 he was offered a colorful role in an odd lit t le film, which broughtan upsurge in int erest in his career.


An upsurge in drug use somet imes leads to an upsurge in crime. An upsurge of flu cases can be cause for alarm. And an upsurge of fury at overpaid CEOs might lead to new legislat ion to restrain high salaries. We seem to use upsurge more in negat ive cont ext s than in posit ive ones, but notalways; we usually welcome an upsurge of consumer confidence, an upsurge in new-car sales, or an upsurge in the st ock market .
 
==========insurgency                      A usually violentat t empt to take control of a government ; a rebellion or uprising.


?
 The Mexican press was fascinat ed by the armed insurgency's myst erious leader, who wore a mask and went by the name of Subcomandant e Marcos.


Insurgencies fall int o the cat egory of "irregular warfare," since an insurgency normally lacks the organizat ion of a revolut ion, even though ithas the same aims. Revolut ions oft en begin within a country's armed forces, whereas insurgencies oft en arise in remot e areas, where they gain strength slowly by winning the confidence of rural populat ions. An insurgency may be based on ethnic or religious ident it y, or it s root s may be basically polit ical or economic. Since insurgencies are rarely strong enough to face a nat ional army head-on, insurgents (oft en called guerrillas) t end to use such tact ics as bombing, kidnapping, hostage taking, and hijacking.
 
==========count erinsurgent
      A person  taking  military  or polit ical act ion against guerrillas or revolut ionaries.


?
 Count erinsurgent s who build trust with the local populat ion will gradually begin to receive useful informat ion.


A count erinsurgent is, as you might guess, someone who combat s an insurgency. Counterinsurgency effort s oft en at t empt to win the "heart s and minds" of a populat ion by hiring and paying local villagers, opening health clinics and schools, organizing sport s programs, and providing agricult ural assistance. These t erms were first used to describe the American effort to strengthen the South Viet namese governmentagainst communist forces in the 1960s-an effort that event ually ended in defeat .
 
==========resurgent                           Rising again int o life, act ivit y, or prominence.


?
 The country had let down it s guard over the summer, and in the fall a resurgent flu virus overwhelmed the public-health syst em, killing t ens of thousands.


Resurgent means lit erally a "rising again"  (see RE). We may speak of a resurgent  baseball t eam, a resurgent st eel industry, the resurgence of jogging, or a resurgence of violence in a war z one. Resurgence is part icularly prominent in it s Italian translat ion, risorgimento. In the 19th cent ury, when the Italian peninsula consist ed of  a number of small independent stat es, a popular movement known as the Risorgiment o managed to unify the peninsula and creat e the modern stat e of Italy in 1870.

==========STRAT comes from the Latin word stratum, meaning "spread" or "bed." Strata, a form of the same word, came to be used by the Romans to mean "paved road"-that is, street.
 
==========strat um                   (1) A layer of a substance, especially one of a series of layers. (2) A level of societ y made up of people of the same rank or posit ion.


?
 Alcohol and drug abuse are found in every strat um of societ y.


In geology, a strat um is a layer of rock or soil that is dist inct from those above and below it . Rock and soil strata (not ice the plural form) can be seen in road cut s, cliffs, quarries, riverbanks, and sand dunes, and in  pieces  of  limest one, slat e, and  shale. Archaeologist s  digging  in hist orical sit es are careful to not e the strat um where each art ifact is found. Earth scient ist s divide the earth's at mosphere int o strata, justas oceanographers divide the ocean's depths int o strata. And for social scient ist s, a strat um is a group of people who are similar in some way, such as educat ion, cult ure, or income.
 
==========strat ificat ion
      The process or stat e of being formed, deposit ed, or arranged in layers.


?
 The strat ificat ion of the lake in summer keeps oxygen-rich cold wat er at the bot t om, where coldwat er fish such as trout take refuge.


If you look for it , you'll find strat ificat ion almost everywhere. On a tall rain-forest tree, there may be differentair plant s clinging to it , different insect s crawling on it , and different mammals making their homes at different levels. The earth beneath you may be stratified int o several dist inct ive layers within the first 20 feet . If the wind you're feeling is moving at 10 miles per hour, at 30 feetabove your head it may be 20 mph, and in the jet stream above that it may be 150 mph. If you climb a high mountain in Himalayas, you may begin in a lush, wet forestand end up in a windswept environment where not even lichen will grow.
 
==========substrat e                           (1) An underlying layer. (2) The base on which an organism lives.


?
 The soil is the substrat e of most seed plant s.


With it s Latin prefix sub-, "below" (see SUB) , substrate obviously refers to a  layer  under something else. Rock may serve as the substrat e for the coral in a coral reef. Tiny wafers of silicon (or another semiconduct or) serve as the substrat e for comput er chips. Substrate may also mean subsoil-that is, the layer under the t opsoil, lacking in organic mat t er or humus. Substrate is part of the vocabulary of various other sciences, including chemistry and biology. Butalthough it 's most ly a scient ific t erm, writ ers may also use it to mean simply "foundat ion"- for instance, when observing thatreading is the substrat e on which most other learning is based.
 
==========strat ocumulus
               A  low-lying  cloud  format ion  appearing  as ext ensive and oft en dark horizontal layers, with t ops rounded int o large balls or rolls.


?
 A dark bank of strat ocumulus clouds was moving in quickly, and in March that usually meant bad weather.


When a cloud t ype forms a broad "layer" over the earth, the strat- root shows up in it s scient ific name. The t ype called simply stratus forms a low layer of gray ext ending over a large area. Cirrostratus ("curl layer") clouds form a  high, thin layer oft en  covering  the  ent ire  sky (but without the wispy curls of ice crystals that give pure cirrus clouds their name). Altostratus ("high layer") clouds form a darkish gray mid-alt it ude layer. Nimbostratus ("rainst orm layer") clouds form a low, dark layer of gray cloud that usually produces light but cont inuous rain, snow, or sleet (but not violent st orms of the kind that give pure nimbus clouds their name). Cumulus ("heap") is the familiar puffy fair-weather t ype of cloud; strat ocumulus is it s more wintry version, which spreads out in a fairly flat layer, much less "heaped up," and somet imes dense enough to cover almost the whole sky.
 
==========LATER comes from the Latin adject ive lateralis, meaning "side." The noun for "side" in Latin w a s latus, and the same word  served  as  an  adject ive  meaning  "wide."  The  relat ionship bet ween the two isn'thard to spot , since something wide ext ends far out to it s sides. So lines of latitude ext end east -westaround the earth, in the dimension we t end to think of as it s width (unlike lines of longitude, which ext end north-south, in the dimension that , for some reason, we decided to think of as it s "length").
 
==========lat eral                      Of or relat ing to the side.


?
 Only in the lat eral views did the X-rays reveal an suspicious-looking shadow on the lung.


Lat eral shows up in all kinds of cont ext s. A lat eral job change is one that keeps you atabout  the same job level and salary. A coach mighthave special drills to improve his players' lat eral speed and agilit y. The Brit ish speak of "lat eral thinking," thinking that grabs ideas that may not seem to be relevant but t urn out to work well-what we might call "thinking out side the box." But we know lateral best from foot ball. A lat eral pass is a pass of the ball bet ween t eammat es that usually goes to the side and slight ly backward from the direct ion in which they're advancing; unlike a forward pass, a lat eral may be made from any posit ion, and any number may be made in a single play.
 
==========bilat eral                           Involving two groups or countries.


?
 Inst ead of working on a set of separat e bilat eral trade agreement s, they propose bringing the countries of the region t ogether to sign a single jointagreement .


Since the prefix bi- means "t wo" in Latin (see BI/BIN), bilateral means essent ially "t wo-sided." In the days when there were two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union regularly engaged in bilat eral arms negot iat ions; such negot iat ions are much less common t oday. Somet imes bilateral refers to two sides of the same thing. A bilat eral hip replacement , for instance, replaces both hip bones in the same operat ion. And bilateral symmetry (a t erm oft en used by biologist s) refers to the fact that , in many organisms (such as humans), the left side is basically the mirror image of the right side.
 
==========collat eral
 (1) Associat ed but of secondary importance. (2) Relat ed but not in a direct or close way.


?
 Though the army referred to the civilian deaths as "collat eral damage," since civilians weren't the int ended target s, the incidentaroused int ense anger among the survivors.


If an official talking about some policy refers to a collat eral issue, he or she means something that may be affect ed but isn't central to the discussion. To an anthropologist , your cousin would be called a collat eral relat ive, since he or she (unlike your grandmother, brother, or daught er) is "off to the side" of your direct line of  descent . As  a  noun, collateral  means something provided to a lender as a guarant ee of repayment . So if you take outa loan or mort gage to buy a car or house, the loan agreement usually stat es that the car or house is collat eral that goes to the lender if the sum isn't paid.
 
==========equilat eral
   Having all sides or faces equal.


?
 On her desk she keptan equilat eral prism, through which every morning the sun would project the colors of the spectrum ont o the far wall.


Since equi- means "equal" (see EQU), the meaning of equilateral is easy to guess from it s root s. The word is most ly used in geometry. The standard polygons (many-sided geometrical shapes)-the pentagon, hexagon, octagon, et c.-are assumed to be equilat eral if we don't say otherwise; an equilat eral rectangle has the special name square. But triangles are part icularly important , and many triangles are not equal-sided. The standard polyhedrons (many-sided solids) are also equilat eral. Most  common is the cube, all of whose sides are square. The t etrahedron has four triangular sides and thus is a pyramid with a triangular base, unlike the pyramids of Egypt with their square bases.

==========TOM comes from the Greek root meaning "cut ." Thus, the Latin word anatomia, from which we getanatomy, means "dissect ion"-that is cut t ing or separat ing the part s of an organism for detailed examinat ion. In a lobotomy, the nerves linking a brain lobe to the rest of the brain are removed; even though lobot omies have hardly been performed in the last 50 years, the idea can st ill fill us with horror.
 
==========appendect omy
         Surgical removal of the human appendix.


?
 Appendect omy is an emergency procedure, since appendicit is can be fatal if it s sympt oms are ignored.


Th e appendix is a t iny t ube at tached to the large int est ine that no longer has any real funct ion. Appendicitis-inflammat ion and swelling of the  appendix, usually  as  a  result  of bact erial infect ion-generally occurs bet ween the ages of 10 and 19, and is the most common reason for  emergency surgery in the U.S. t oday. Since the appendix has so lit t le to do, appendect omies normally have no negat ive aft ereffect s  at  all. If  appendicit is  is  ignored, bact eria may ent er the blood and infect other part s of the body.
 
==========gastrect omy
   Surgical removal of all or part of the st omach.


?
 Gastrect omy is used to treatholes in the st omach wall, noncancerous t umors, and cancer, but is performed only when other treat ment s have been reject ed.


Gastr- comes from the Greek word for "belly," and shows up in English in such words as gastric ("relat ing to the st omach") and gastronomy ("the cooking and eat ing of fine food"). Believe it or not , there are many people t oday who have had a gastrect omy and live withouta st omach; some of them need to eat fairly st eadily and carefully through the day, but many lead almost complet ely normal and even vigorous lives.
 
==========t onsillect omy
        Surgical removal of the t onsils.


?
 His daught er's usual doct or thoughtant ibiot ics could cure her swollen t onsils, buta specialistrecommended t onsillect omy.


The t onsils are the areas of t issue that you can see in the mirror on both sides of your throat (not to be confused with the uvula, which hangs down in the middle). Tonsillect omy, the most common surgery performed on children in the U.S., is int ended to relieve tonsillitis, or inflammat ion of the t onsils (usually by strep or staph bact eria). But the fact is, t onsillit is can oft en be successfully treat ed with ant ibiot ics, which means that surgery, including the week or two of pain and discomfort that follows it , is generally unnecessary.
 
==========mast ect omy
   Surgical removal of all or part of the breast .


?
 She has always dreaded being disfigured by mast ect omy, buther talks with the surgeon have calmed her considerably.


Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American women. Early cases can oft en be treat ed with drugs or with a small operat ion called a lumpectomy (because itremoves a lump). Though a "simple mast ect omy" is larger than a lumpect omy, itallows  the  breast to be reconstruct ed, using art ificial implant s or t issue from elsewhere on the  body. But  "radical mast ect omy," which is required when the cancer is atan advanced stage, takes much of the chest muscle and makes reconstruct ion impossible.
 
==========IATR, from the Greek iatros, "healer, physician," usually hides in the middle of words, where it isn't immediat ely not iced. A pediatrician treat s children (see PED-). A psychiatrist is a physician who treat s mental problems. (A psychologist , by contrast , doesn'thave a medical degree and thus can't prescribe drugs.) And a physiatrist is a doct or who pract ices "physical medicine and rehabilitat ion," which may involve such things as t est ing various physical abilit ies, relieving pain through electric heat or massage, or training pat ient s to exercise or to use an art ificial limb.
 
==========iatrogenic
     Caused accidentally by medical treat ment .


?
 Most medical malpract ice suit s seek compensat ion for iatrogenic injury.


In the 21st cent ury, pat ient s with throat infect ions are no longer being bled to death by misguided doct ors, like the unfort unat e George Washingt on. But iatrogenic injury and death st ill remain serious risks. Because of a doct or's bad handwrit ing, a pat ient may be given the wrong powerful drug. The sheer number of drugs on the markethas led to dangerous drug int eract ions, which oft en occur when one doct or doesn't know whatanother is doing. Too many pat ient s go to the hospital for some common treat mentand pick up an ant ibiot ic- resistant staph infect ion. And let 's not even think about those unlucky pat ient s who wake up to find that the surgeon has removed the wrong foot .
 
==========bariatric
   Relat ing to or specializing in the treat ment of obesit y.


?
 In the t ype of bariatric surgery called gastric bypass, part of the st omach is act ually stapled off.


Baros means "weight " in Greek; so, for example, a barometer is an instrument that measures air pressure or weight . Bariatric describes the medical treat ment of serious overweight -that is, obesit y. Bariatric surgery is only employed when other methods of weight loss have been tried and failed. Though stapling the st omach may seem extreme, we now know that obesit y great ly increases the risk of heart disease, diabet es, cancer, and stroke, so st omach surgery doesn't justhelp people look and feel bet t er-it 's a pot ent ial lifesaver.
 
==========geriatric
 Of or relat ing to old people.


?
 We guessed we were now in the hospital's geriatric wing, since all the pat ient s seemed to be elderly.


Since most medical care is devot ed to those over 65, geriatrics, the medical treat ment of the elderly, is a highly important specialt y. The specific problems of the elderly include physical inact ivit y and instabilit y, which result from weakness and loss of energy. Weakness of the eyes and ears plays a role, and weakening of the immune syst em oft en leads to more disease. All these condit ions can be made worse by mental problems, such as declining int ellect ual act ivit y, declining memory, and depression, which may prevent the pat ient from taking act ion to improve his or her condit ion. But the effect s of aging can be great ly relieved by proper care. And the great est improvement oft en result s when the pat ient is persuaded to become more physically, mentally, and socially act ive.
 
==========podiatrist
   A doct or who treat s injuries and diseases of the foot .


?
 Like most podiatrist s, she spends a lot of t ime dealing with minor complaint s like bunions, ankle sprains, arch pain, and hammert oes.


Most foot problems result from the fact thathuman feet were never designed to walk on asphaltand concret e or even to wear shoes (all that cushioning we demand in our shoes may be doing us more harm than good). So t oday we have an ent ire medical specialt y devot ed to feet . In the U.S., a podiatrist is a doct or of podiatric medicine (D.P.M.), who is licensed to perform surgery. The root pod- comes from the Greek word for "foot " (compare PED). But in England a foot doct or is oft en called a chiropodist, a t erm that dat es from the t ime when the same specialist treat ed hands as well, since chiro- means "hand."

MEDI comes from the Latin medius, meaning "middle." Our word medium refers to something in a middle posit ion. The medieval period of European hist ory, also known as the Middle Ages, is the period bet ween Greek and Roman ant iquit y and the "modern age." But why people around 1620 began to use the t erm "Middle Ages," because they regarded themselves as modern, is an int erest ing quest ion.
 
==========median                          In the middle; especially, having a value that is in the middle of a series of values arranged from smallest to largest .


?
 The cit y's west side is well-off but it s east side isn't , so the cit y's median house prices are t ypical for the region.


People oft en use the word average withoutrealizing that there are two common forms of average. Suppose you want to find the average net worth of a group of people-that is, the average value of everything they possess. To find one t ype of average, called the mean, you'd simply add up the t otal value of money and propert y of everyone in the group and divide it by the number of people. To find the other t ype, called the median, you'd ident ify the net worth of the person who is richer than half the people and poorer than the other half. So if Warren Buffet t drove through a t iny village in India, the mean net worth of those in the village would suddenly rise to perhaps a billion dollars, but  their median net worth would remain close to zero. Which figure would be more meaningful?

 
==========mediat e                        (1) To work with opposing sides in an argument or disput e in order to getan agreement . (2) To achieve a set t lement or agreement by working with the opposing sides.


?
 He was the third person who had at t empt ed to mediat e the disput e bet ween the firm and it s striking workers, the first two having given up in despair.


Mediation is oft en used in disput es bet ween companies and labor unions, and the governmentact ually provides mediators for such disagreement s. The mediat or tries to bring the two sides to an agreement , but doesn'thave the power to act ually order such an agreement . Mediat ors also somet imes have a role in int ernat ional disput es; when two neighboring countries claim exclusive fishing right s in the same ocean wat ers, for example, they may invit e a trained mediat or to help set t le the argument . Arbitration is similar to mediat ion, but in arbitrat ion both part ies in a disput e agree to accept the arbitrat or's decision.
 
==========int ermediary
         A person who works with opposing sides in a disput e in order to bring aboutan agreement .


?
 The divorce had been bit t er, and the two now communicat ed only through an old friend who they both trust ed as an int ermediary.


Since inter- means "bet ween, among" (see INTER), an int ermediary is someone who moves back and forth in the middle area bet ween two sides-a "go-bet ween." Mediator (which shares the medi- root ) is oft en a synonym, and so is facilitator; broker and agentare oft en others. Thus, a real-estat e broker or agent shut t les bet ween a house's buyer and seller, who may never even meet each other. Financial intermediation is whathappens when you put money in a bank or invest ment firm, which then invest s it in various companies; if you want , you can inst ead cut out the int ermediary and invest the money direct ly in companies of your own choosing.
 
==========mediocrit y
     The qualit y of being not very good.


?
 He's the kind of person who can get depressed by the mediocrit y of a dinner, or even a wine.


People int erest ed in words always point out that mediocrity doesn't mean quit e what it s main root would indicat e: Why doesn't it describe something that 's right in the middle of the pack, exact ly what you would expect ?
 Inst ead the words mediocrity and mediocre always suggest disappoint ment . A mediocre play is one you wish you hadn't wast ed an evening on, and the mediocre act or in it should probably find another profession. A person can even be called a mediocrit y, though it isn't very nice and you'd never do it to his face.
 
==========OID comes from the Greek word for "appearance" or "form." Since aster in ancient Greek meant "star," the small bodies orbit ing bet ween Mars and Jupit er that looked like stars through primit ive t elescopes were called asteroids. A factoid is a lit t le bit of informat ion that looks like a fact , whether it is or not . And some people these days will at tach -oid to justaboutanything; you can probably figure out the meaning of nutsoid, nerdoid, and freakazoid without much help.
 
==========rhomboid                       In geometry, a shape with four sides where only the opposit e sides and angles are equal.


?
 The flimsy pict ure frame had been damaged en rout e, and it s rectangular shape was now a rhomboid.


Rhomboids, like triangles, may take various different shapes, but they always look like a lopsided diamond or rectangle. As both a noun and an adject ive, rhomboid can be applied to anything with those shapes, such as certain muscles of the upper back when viewed from behind. Whenever you hear aboutrhomboid exercises, rhomboid strain, or rhomboid pain, it involves those muscles, which at tach your shoulder blades to your spine and can be strained by carrying a heavy backpack, serving a t ennis ball, or just slumping in your chair in front of a comput er all day.
 
==========delt oid                       A large muscle of the shoulder.


?
 In Anat omy class she had learned about the delt oids, which her trainer at the gym just called "delt s."


The fourth let t er of the Greek alphabet is delta, and a capital delta is triangle-shaped. In English, delta commonly means the sand deposit s that form a huge triangle at the mouth of certain large rivers. Deltoid as an adject ive means "having a triangular shape," and botanist s oft en use the word to describe the shape of certain leaves. The triangular, swept -back wings seen on jet fight er aircraftare called delta wings. Your delt oid muscles-not far from your rhomboids-form a cap on your shoulders, and some gym trainers even treat shoulder and deltoid as synonyms. Can you guess the general shape of delt oids when seen from the side?

 
==========dendroid
Resembling a tree in form.


?
 The reef was a fantast ic jungle, it s dendroid corals resembling luminous, poisonous trees in a landscape of bizarre beaut y.


Dendrology is the st udy of trees, and those who do the st udying are called dendrologists. So dendroid describes something that "branches" in all direct ions from a central "trunk" in an irregular way. The word is almostalways used by biologist s, who oft en speak of dendroid seaweeds, dendroid moss, and dendroid algae.
 
==========humanoid
      Looking or act ing like a human.


?
 We slowly learn that most of Dr. Bennell's friends  have  been  replaced  by  humanoid subst it ut es thathave emerged from pods.


A humanoid robot , somet imes called an android, is a robot thatresembles a human. Account s of the yet i, Sasquat ch, and Bigfoot cont inue to fascinat e us mainly because of their humanoid charact erist ics. The idea of creat ing a monstrous humanoid, such as the Jewish golem or Vict or Frankenst ein's  creat ion, has  intrigued  us  for  cent uries. "Humanoid Animat ion"  is  a standard for creat ing humanlike figures for video that let s the same figure be used in a variet y of 3-D games-some of which have nothing buthumanoids for charact ers.

==========SCOP, which usually appears in a suffix, comes from the Greek skopein, meaning "t o look at ." In English we have the simple noun scope, along with some other words it somet imes stands for: telescope, microscope, periscope, and so on. And have you ever used a stereoscope, a device your great -grandparent s probably enjoyed, which let s you look through a viewer at two slight ly different phot ographs of the same thing, one with each eye, to enjoy the illusion that you're seeing it in three dimensions?

 
==========endoscope                        A light ed t ubular medical instrument for viewing the int erior or a hollow organ or body part that t ypically has one or more channels to permit passage of surgical instrument s.


?
 Possible uses of the endoscope out side of medicine soon became apparent , and soon mechanics were using specially designed endoscopes to view the insides of jet engines.


The Greek prefix endo- means "within, inside," so around 1860 an early crude instrument for looking deep inside the body was named the endoscope. But modern endoscopy required the invent ion of the electric light bulb and then fiber-opt ic cable, so the first modern endoscopes dat e only to 1967. An endoscope may be insert ed through a nat ural passageway (for example, through the nose or down the esophagus) or through a t iny cut in the skin. A t iny camera with a lightat the end of the cable sends back images ont o a screen, and the surgeon uses special instrument s that work through a t ube alongside the cable. There are now specialized t ypes of endoscopes for every part of the body, where they can take t issue samples, cut out small growths, or remove foreign object s.
 
==========arthroscopic
      Relat ing to a  fiber-opt ic  instrument  that  is  insert ed through an incision near a joint to examine the joint 's int erior.


?
 The day he scheduled the fourth arthroscopic operat ion on his knee was the day he decided to hang up his foot ball cleat s.


In Greek, arthron means "joint ." Arthritis is a condit ion of swollen and painful joint s, and arthropods are animals (including insect s, arachnids, and crustaceans) thathave a segment ed body and joint ed limbs. Arthroscopic surgery, or arthroscopy, has revolut ionized the treat ment of joint injuries. It 's performed with an arthroscope, a specialized t ype of endoscope (see above). A t iny camera and a lightare insert ed through a small cut in the skin, and through another cut nearby a t iny surgical instrument , controlled through it s own cable, is insert ed. The surgeon then performs the operat ion, guided by the images sent back via the fiber-opt ic cable. Most pat ient s walk out of the hospital on crut ches the same day, though full recovery may take a couple of months.
 
==========laparoscopy
   Examinat ion of the int erior of the abdomen using a fiber- opt ic instrument insert ed through a cut in the abdomen's wall.


?
 The init ial laparoscopy involves insert ing the cable through a t iny cutand inflat ing the int ernal area with carbon dioxide so thata good-sized area will become visible.


Sin ce laparo- means "wall of the abdomen," a laparoscope is an endoscope designed especially to examine the abdomen. Common laparoscopic surgeries include removal of the gallbladder, appendix, or kidney, and removal of t umors from abdominal organs. Like the other endoscopic surgeries, laparoscopy, as compared to tradit ional surgery, reduces risk of bleeding, pain following the operat ion, pat ientrecovery t ime, and length of hospital stays.
 
==========oscilloscope
 An  instrument   that   shows  visual  images  of  changing electrical current on a screen.


?
 An oscilloscope next to the bed was monit oring her vital signs, but otherwise it was hard for a visit or to be sure she was even alive.


In Latin oscillare means "t o swing," and our word oscillation usually  means  "vibrat ion"  or "variat ion," especially in a changing flow of electricit y. The oscilloscope basically draws a graph of an electrical signal. Since all kinds of physical phenomena can be convert ed int o an electric voltage, oscilloscopes can be used to measure such things as sound, light , and heat . So an oscilloscope can analyze how one clarinet 's sound is different from another's, or how one bulb's light differs from another's. Aut o mechanics use  oscilloscopes to measure  engine vibrat ions; doct ors use them to measure brain waves. Audio t echnicians use oscilloscopes to diagnose problems in audio equipment ; TV and radio t echnicians use them to diagnose TV and radio problems. But oscilloscopes are most essent ial t oday to high-t ech electronics experimentat ion.
 
==========TRANS  comes  from Latin to indicat e  movement  "through, across, or beyond"  something. Translation carries a writ er's meaning from one language to another. A t elevision signal is sent or transmitted through the air (or a cable) to your set . When making your way through a cit y on public transportation, you may have to transfer from one bus or subway to another.
 
==========transient
    (1) Not last ing long; short -lived. (2) Passing through a place and staying only briefly.


?
 It 's a college t own, so much of it s populat ion is transient .


A transient mood is one that passes quickly. A brief  st opover in a t own on your way to somewhere else is a transient visit . A summer job on a farm is transient work, last ing only as long as the growing season. You may occasionally experience a transient episode of dizziness or weakness, which vanishes withouta trace. As a noun, transient means a person who passes through a place, staying only briefly. The hoboes and tramps of earlier years were some of our most colorful transient s, known  for hopping  freight  trains, panhandling  on  the  street , and st ealing homemade pies cooling on the windowsill.
 
==========transfigurat ion A change in form or appearance; a glorifying spirit ual change.


?
 Being in love caused a complet e transfigurat ion of her personalit y.


The  Gospels  relat e  that  one  day  Jesus  t ook  three  disciples  up  a  mountain, where  they wit nessed his transfigurat ion int o divine form: his face shone like the sun, his garment s became brilliant ly  whit e,  and  a  voice  from  heaven  proclaimed  that  this  was  the  son  of  God. Transfiguration was first used in English as the name of this biblical event , and the Feast of the Transfigurat ion remains the name of a holy day. So the word has always kepta somewhatreligious-and almostalways posit ive-t one. A face may be transfigured by joy, and an "ugly duckling" may be slowly transfigured int o a radiant  beaut y. And as Harry Pot t er fans know, transfigurat ion is a subject long taughtat the Hogwart s School by Minerva McGonagall.
 
==========transponder
  A radio or radar set that emit s a radio signal aft er receiving such a signal.


?
 When a pat ient is admit t ed to an emergency room, an implant ed transponder can relay important data abouthis or her medical hist ory.


This word was coined during World War I by simply joining pieces of the words transmitter and responder. Transponders are basic to modern aviat ion and communicat ions sat ellit es, and they're finding new uses in fields such as medicine as well. But they're now also part of everyday  life.  The  "E-ZPass"  that  let s  you  drive  right  through  t urnpike  t ollbooths  is  a transponder, and the car you're driving may not even start unless itrecognizes the signal from your personal key's transponder. In a big crowded footrace, you may carry a t iny transponder on your shoe thatrecords when you cross both the start ing line and the finish line.
 
==========transcendent                          (1) Exceeding or rising above usual limit s; supreme. (2) Beyond comprehension; beyond ordinary experience or mat erial exist ence.


?
 Despit e the chaos around her she remained calm, with a transcendent smile on her face.


The Latin verb scandere means "t o climb," so transcend has the basic meaning of climbing so high that you cross some boundary. A transcendent experience is one that takes you out of yourself and convinces you of a larger life or exist ence; in this sense, it means something close to "spirit ual." The American writ ers and thinkers known as the Transcendentalists, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau, believed in the unit y of all creat ion, the basic goodness of humankind, and the superiorit y of spirit ual vision over mere logic. When we speak of the transcendent importance of an issue such as climat e change, we may mean that everything else on earth act ually depends on it .

==========PRO is an important prefix, with a couple of quit e different broad meanings. In this sect ion, we'll look at words in which pro- has the basic meaning "for" or "favoring."

==========proact ive                           Act ing in ant icipat ion of fut ure problems, needs, or changes.


?
 Our president prides  himself on being proact ive, and is  always imagining sit uat ions  the company might be facing in three or four years.


People who t end to react to a problem only when it 's got t en serious could be called reactive people. Unt il recent ly, reactive (in this sense) didn'treally have an ant onym. So proactive was coined to describe the kind of person who's always looking int o the fut ure in order to be prepared for anything. A good parentat t empt s to be proact ive on behalf of his or her children, trying to imagine the problems they might be facing in a few months or years. A company's financial officers st udy the pat t erns of the company's earnings to make sure it won'trisk running short of cash atany point in the next year or t wo. Proactive has only been around a few decades, and it can st ill somet imes sound like a fashionable buzzword.
 
==========pro bono                      Being, involved in, or doing professional work, and especially legal work, donat ed for the public good.


?
 The law firm allows her to do several hours of pro bono work every week, and she devot es it to helping poor immigrant families.


In Latin, pro bono publico means "for the public good"; in English we generally short en the phrase to pro bono. Donat ing free legal help to those who need ithas long been a pract ice of American law firms; the American Bar Associat ion act ually recommends thatall lawyers donat e 50 hours a year. Pro bono work is somet imes donat ed by nonlegal firms as well. For example, an advert ising firm might produce a 60-second video for an environmental or educat ional organizat ion, or a strat egic-planning firm might prepare a start -up plan for a charit y that funds shelt ers for bat t ered women.
 
==========proponent
    One who argues in favor of something: advocat e.


?
 The new governor is a proponent of a longer school year, and he's got t en a lot of support from parent s.


Proponent comes from the same Latin word as propose, so a proponent is someone who proposes something, or at least support s it by speaking and writ ing in favor of it . Thus, for example, proponent s of casinos argue that they creat e jobs, whereas proponent s of a casino ban-that is, casino opponents-argue that they're corrupt ing and they take money away from people who can'tafford it . As a rule, justaboutanything important that get s proposed also get s opposed.
 
==========pro forma
  Done or exist ing as something that is required but thathas lit t le true meaning or importance.


?
 The let t er she received from him aft er her husband's death struck her as pro forma, and she knew the old friendship bet ween the two men had never really been repaired.


A lot of things are done for the sake of appearances. A t eacher might get officially observed and evaluat ed every three years, even though everyone knows she's t errific and the whole thing is strict ly pro forma. A crit ic might say thata orchestral conduct or gave a pro forma performance, since his heart wasn't in it . A business owner might make a pro forma appearance at the funeral of a polit ician's mother, never having mether but maybe hoping for a favor from her son somet ime in the fut ure. In business, pro forma has some special meanings; a pro forma invoice, for example, will listall the it ems being sent but , unlike a true invoice, won't be an act ual bill.
 
==========PRO, in it s other broad meaning, means "before, in front of." So, for example, to proceed means "t o move out in front "; to progress means to "t o move forward"; and somebody prominent stands out , as if he or she were act ually standing out in front of the crowd.
 
==========protrude                       To jut out from the surrounding surface or cont ext .


?
 As he leaned over, she not iced something protruding from under his jacket , and realized with a sickening feeling thathe was armed.


Since trudere means "t o thrust " in Latin, protrude means basically "t o thrust forward." If your neighbors' pat io protrudes over your propert y boundary, you may want to discuss it with them. A protruding disc in your spine may have to be operat ed on sooner or lat er; superficial protrusions, such as corns or bunions, t end to be less serious than more deeply root ed ones.
 
==========prophylaxis
  Measures designed to preserve health and prevent  the spread of disease.


?
 For rabies, prophylaxis in the form of vaccines for cat s and dogs is much bet t er than treat ing them aft er being bit t en.


In Greek, phylax means "guard," so prophylactic measures guard against disease by taking act ion ahead of t ime. Thus, for example, before the polio vaccine became available, prophylaxis against polio included avoiding crowds and public swimming pools. These days a well-known kind of prophylactic is used to prevent sexually transmit t ed diseases; but prophylact ic measures only work when people use them.
 
==========promulgat e
    (1) To proclaim or make public. (2) To put (a law) int o effect .


?
 The country's new const it ut ion was officially promulgat ed in a grand ceremony at the president ial palace.


All laws need to be made public in some way so that cit izens may know if they're in danger of breaking them. Since they can't be expect ed to go int o effect unt il the populat ion knows they exist , promulgate has the two meanings "proclaim" and "put int o effect ." In ancient Greece and Rome, when most people couldn'tread, a new writ t en law would act ually be proclaimed in a public place; we've all seen such scenes in hist orical movies. But t oday promulgation of a law generally occurs simply by it s being published in an official government publicat ion and on a government Web sit e. New laws are also oft en report ed in newspapers and on TV, though rarely in complet e form.
 
==========prologue     (1) An introduct ion to a lit erary work. (2) An introduct ory event  or development .


?
 The Bost on Tea Part y of 1773 t urned out to be a prologue to the American Revolut ion.


In ancient Greek drama, the prologos (a word that means basically "speaking before") was the opening port ion of the play, before the entry of the all-important chorus. It might be spoken by a single act or, maybe playing a god, who would "set the scene" for the audience. Playwright s t oday inst ead oft en provide the same kind of "scene-set t ing" informat ion through dialogue near the play's beginning; in movies, it may appear (as in the "Star Wars" series) in the form of act ual writ t en t ext . In a nonfict ion book, the lead-in is now usually called a preface or introduction; novels rarely provide any introduct ion atall. St ill, prologue remains a useful word for nonlit erary purposes. The saying "The past is prologue" t ells us that , in real life, almost everything can be a prologue to what follows it .

==========RE is a prefix which, like pro- (see PRO), has more than one meaning. In this sect ion, we'll focus on the meaning "again." We use re- words with this meaning every day-redo, reheat, recheck, reread, resell, repaint, et c.-and we feel free to make up new ones as needed. But in plent y of other re- words, the meaning isn't so obvious.
 
==========remorse                     A deep regretarising from a sense of guilt for past wrongs.


?
 Remorse for the accident that occurred that night seems to have alt ered the course of the senat or's life.


In Latin, mordere means "t o bit e"; thus, remorse is something that "gnaws" at you over and over. In criminal court , judges are always looking for signs thata convict ed felon is suffering remorse for his crime; if not , the judge may well lengthen his sent ence or deny him parole aft er serving part of it . Remorse is stronger than mere regret ; real remorse is the kind of thing that may lasta lifet ime.
 
==========reit erat e                           To stat e or do over again or repeat edly.


?
 At the end of every class, Professor Lewis reit erat es that we should getan early start on our t erm papers.


In Latin, iterum means "again," so reiterate has the basic meaning of "repeat over and over." Our word iteration is used a lot by comput er programmers t oday, oft en meaning a repeat ed response to program instruct ions that get s something closer to it s final form, butalso oft en meaning a new version of something, such as a program. Buta reiteration is simply a repeat or several repeat s.
 
==========rejuvenat e
  To make young or youthful again; to give new vigor t o.


?
 He was in bad shape aft er his wife's death, but everyone says he's been rejuvenat ed by his remarriage.


Juvenis, Latin for "young," can be seen in a word such as juvenile. Rejuvenation is something that can be carried out on a creaky old house, a clunker of a car, a sluggish career, a weak economy, or a company that 's lost it s edge, butrejuvenate and rejuvenation are probably used most oft en for talking about our physical selves. Ads for lot ions promise skin rejuvenat ion; diet - book covers show rejuvenat ed (or maybe just young) models burst ing with health. We st ill seem to be searching for that "Fuent e de la Juvent ud" that Juan Ponce de Len failed to discover five hundred years ago.
 
==========reconcile                           (1) To make agree. (2) To make friendly again.


?
 Now she has to reconcile her liking for her brother-in-law with the news thathe was picked up for armed robbery last week.


In Latin, conciliare means "t o calm, soothe"; thus, reconcile means essent ially "t o calm again." Warring friends can oft en be reconciled by a nice not e or apology. When you're faced with two things that don't square very well, you may have to reconcile them, the way a scient ist might try to reconcile the differing result s from two research project s. The U.S. House and Senat e, in a  process  called reconciliation, try to produce one final bill from two different  versions that they've passed separat ely. To reconcile yourself to something means to get used to it ; thus, you may need to reconcile yourself to not get t ing to the beach next summer, or you may have reconciled yourself to the idea of your daught er in the Peace Corps marrying a Mongolian goatherder.
 
==========RE-, in it s other main sense, means "back" or backward." Since doing something again means going back to it , the two senses are act ually relat ed; st ill, the meaning of re- in most words is pret t y clearly one or the other. So a rebound comes back at you; to recall means to "call back" a memory; and to react is to "act back" at someone else's act ion.
 
==========reciprocal
 (1) Done, given, or felt equally by both sides. (2) Relat ed to each other in such a way that one complet es the other or is the equal of the other.


?
 They had done us a great favor, so as a reciprocal gest ure we invit ed them for a weekend on the island.


In Latin, reciprocus means "ret urning the same way" or "alt ernat ing." So in a reciprocating engine, like  the  one  in  your  car, the  pist ons  move  back  and  forth, and  that  mot ion  is transformed int o the rotary mot ion of the crankshaft . A reciprocal is a pair of numbers (such as 5/6 and 6/5) that can be mult iplied to produce 1. Reciprocity (with the accent on the third syllable) bet ween two nat ions means they agree to recognize certain things grant ed in one country as being valid in the other-for example, your driver's license.
 
==========rebut                 (1) To oppose by argument . (2) To prove to be wrong.


?
 The claims aboutreceiving payoffs from builders were event ually rebut t ed by the mayor's office, but the damage had been done.


The -but in rebut once meant basically "but t ," so rebut's original meanings were "t o drive or beat back" and "t o at tack  with violent language." Rebuttals can st ill be rather violent , as anyone who has wat ched some heat ed moment s in a president ial debat e can t est ify. The word is oft en used by lawyers, since the lawyer for the accused or for the part y being sued almostalways tries to rebut the charges againsthis or her client ; but it 's also used in plent y of cont ext s out side the courtroom.
 
==========revoke     To officially cancel the power or effect of something (such as a law, order, or privilege).


?
 His real-estat e license had been revoked aft er his convict ion for fraud three years earlier.


Since vocare means "t o call" in Latin (see VOC), to revoke is to "call back." Your driver's license could be revoked aft er about three convict ions for driving under the influence of alcohol; some people's licenses are even revoked for life. You could get  your passport  revoked if a judge thought you had violat ed the t erms of your bail and suspect ed you might skip the country. And if you're out of prison on probat ion and violat e the t erms of probat ion, it will probably be revoked and you'll end up back in the slammer.
 
==========regress                   To ret urn to an earlier and usually worse or less developed condit ion or stat e.


?
 In the years since she had left , the country seemed to have  regressed  badly, and  it s corrupt ion and dire povert y had got t en much harder to ignore.


As you  might guess, regress is the opposit e of progress. So if a disease regresses, that 's generally a good thing, but in most other ways we prefer not to regress. If someone's mental stat e has been improving, we hope he or she won't start to regress; and when a nat ion's promising educat ional syst em begins to regress, that 's a bad sign for the country's fut ure. Economist s oft en dist inguish bet ween a progressive tax and a regressive tax; in a progressive tax, the percentage that goes to taxes get s larger as the amount of money being taxed get s larger, while in a regressive tax the percentage get s smaller. (Rich people prefer regressive  taxes.)

==========DERM comes from the Greek derma, meaning "skin." For medical advice on a skin problem such as acne, we may go to a dermatologist, or skin specialist . When we geta shot , it 's usually with  a hypodermic, a needle that goes "under the skin" (see HYP/HYPO). A pachyderm is a "thick-skinned" animal, which most of us just call an elephant .
 
==========dermal                      Relat ing to the skin and especially to the dermis.


?
 The agency is always st udying what can be done to prevent dermal exposure to chemicals in the workplace.


The word dermal oft en comes up nowadays in connect ion with cosmet ic treat ment s. Dermal therapy usually means rest oring moist ure to dry, cracked skin. Dermal fillers such as collagen can  be  inject ed to fill in  acne  scars or reduce  wrinkles. These  have  now  been  joined  by treat ment s like Bot ox, which paralyzes facial dermal muscles, again in order to reduce wrinkles (since those dermal muscles are used to form expressions). A synonym for dermal is cutaneous.
 
==========epidermis
  The out er layer of the skin.


?
 The epidermis is the body's first line of defense against infect ion, ext ernal injury, and environmental stresses.


Epidermis includes the Greek prefix epi-, meaning "out er" (see EPI); thus, the epidermis overlies th e dermis, or inner layer of skin. The  epidermis it self consist s of four or five layers; the out ermost layer is made of dead cells, which are being shed cont inuously. The epidermis act s as a physical barrier-a prot ect ive wrap over the body's surface, which, by prevent ing wat er loss, allows vert ebrat es to live on land.
 
==========taxidermist
 One who prepares, st uffs, and mount s the skins of dead animals.


?
 The taxidermist suggest ed that the bobcat be displayed in the act of leaping fiercely t oward the viewer.


Taxidermist s are called on not  only by sport smen and collect ors but  by museums, movie st udios, and advert isers. Taxidermist s firstremove the skin (with it s fur, hair, or feathers), then creat e a plast er cast of the carcass with which to produce a "mannequin," on which they replace the skin. Producing trophies of lifelike qualit y that oft en recreat e an excit ing momentrequires physical skill, at t ent ion to detail, and somet imes art ist ic talent .
 
==========dermat it is
Inflammat ion of the skin.


?
 The only dermat it is she had ever suffered had been the result of playing in poison ivy when she was lit t le.


Dermat it is usually appears as a rash, and may cause it ching, blist ers, swelling, and oft en scabbing and scaling. It oft en marks an allergic react ion of some kind. Contact dermatitis is caused by something (oft en a chemical) t ouching the skin. Atopic dermatitis usually affect s the insides of the elbows, the backs of the knees, and the face; generally result ing from an inherit ed sensit ivit y, it 's oft en triggered by inhaling something. Eczema, psoriasis, and dandruff are all forms of dermat it is. Even in the worst cases, dermat it is isn't infect ious and doesn't produce serious health consequences.
 
==========ENDO comes from the Greek endon, meaning "within." In English itappears almostalways in scient ific t erms, especially in biology. A nonscient ific endo-  word is endogamy, meaning marriage within a specific group as required by cust om or law-one of the many cust oms that can be seen everywhere from the mostremot e tribes to the  highest  societ y  in  wealthy countries.
 
==========endocrine
   (1) A hormone. (2) Any of several glands (such as the thyroid) that pour their secret ions direct ly int o the blood or lymph.


?
 Since the endocrines are so vital to human life, affect ing such things as cell growth and blood sugar, the chemicals known as endocrine disrupt ers can be destruct ive and even deadly.


The body's glands remove specific substances from the blood and alt er them for rerelease int o the blood or removal. Glands such as those that produce saliva and sweat secret e their product s through t iny duct s or t ubes on or near the body's surface. The glands without duct s, called the endocrine glands, inst ead secret e their product s int o the bloodstream; the endo- root indicat es that the secret ions are int ernal rather than on the surface. The endocrine syst em includes such glands as the pit uitary (which controls  growth, regulat es the other endocrines, and performs many other tasks), the thyroid (another growth gland thatalso influences  metabolism),  the  adrenals  (which  secret e  adrenaline  and   st eroids),   the hypothalamus (which influences sleep and weightregulat ion), and the ovaries (which produce eggs). Endocrine problems are treat ed by endocrinologists.
 
==========endodont ic
 Relat ing to a branch of dent istry that deals with the pulp of the t eeth.


?
 Her dent ist t old her the problem was endodont ic and that she should see a specialist soon to prevent loss of the t ooth.


Endodontists, as you might expect from the endo- root , deal with the int erior of the t ooth. The t ooth's enamel, on the out side, covers a thick layer called the dentin; this in t urn surrounds the innermost part , called the pulp, a mass of soft t issue through which nerves and blood vessels run. When a t ooth has been badly damaged by decay or cracking, producing a risk of dangerous infect ion of the pulp, a "root canal" procedure is performed by an endodont ist . Try to avoid ever get t ing to know an  endodont ist ; brush  your t eeth  t wice  daily, floss  before bedt ime, and never leta cavit y go unfilled for long.
 
==========endogenous
      Developing or originat ing within a cell, organ, body, or syst em.


?
 Vitamin D can be obtained from food and supplement s, but it 's also an endogenous vitamin, produced by the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight .


When biologist s need to make a dist inct ion bet ween things thatare produced within a cell or organ and things thataffect it from the out side, they use the t erms endogenous and exogenous. It used to be thought , for instance, that mutat ions in cells always result ed from exogenous causes, unt il it was discovered that substances in the body, including those called oxidant s, could cause them endogenously as well. "Circadian rhythms"-the regular cycles, roughly 24 hours in length, that plant s, animals, and humans rely on to regulat e their days-are endogenously generat ed and don'tact ually depend on the sun for their t iming.
 
==========endorphin
 Any of a group of prot eins in the brain thatare able to relieve pain.


?
 On the final stret ch of her daily five-mile run, she could usually count on the endorphins kicking in, giving her that beaut iful "runner's high."


The word endorphin was coined, back when the substances were discovered in the 1970s, by joining pieces of endogenous and morphine, morphine being a narcot ic that closely resembles the endorphins and relieves pain in a similar way. St udies suggest that the pain-relieving pract ice called acupunct ure (see acupunct ure) works by releasing endorphins. Endorphins also seem to play an importantrole in pregnancy. Though much remains to be learned about the endorphins, the general public seems ready to give them credit for any all-nat ural high.

NECRO PALEO CIRCU/CIRCUM MINI/MINU INTER SUR CO SYN WordsfromMythologyand Hist ory
Quiz29-1 Quiz29-2 Quiz29-3 Quiz29-4 Quiz29-5 ReviewQuizzes29

NECRO comes from the  Greek nekros, meaning "dead body," so it 's not surprising that it shows up in some unappet izing places. A necrophagous insect , for instance, is one that feeds on dead bodies; when homicide invest igat ors discover a corpse, they may use the insect evidence to figure out when the person died.
 
==========necrosis
 Death of living t issue, usually within a limit ed area.


?
 He had ignored the spider bit e for several days, and his doct or was alarmed to see that serious necrosis had set in.


Cells die nat urally aft er a period of t ime, but may also die as a result of injuries, infect ions, or cancer. Burns produce necrosis, and the bedsores suffered by nursing-home pat ient s are a form of necrosis. The dreaded condit ion known as gangrene, in which the dying t issue t urns black or green, is another form. When untreat ed, the dying cells release substances that lead to the death of surrounding cells, so untreat ed necrosis can lead to death. Treat ment usually requires the removal of the necrotic t issue, and in severe cases can even involve amputat ing a limb.
 
==========necromancer
 One who conjures the spirit s of the dead in order to magically reveal the fut ure or influence the course of event s.


?
 Her specialt y is communicat ion with the dead, and she might once have been known as a necromancer, buther sign says simply "Psychic."


The pract ice of necromancy goes back as far as the ancientassyrians and Babylonians and has cont inued through all the cent uries since. In the Middle Ages it became associat ed with black magic; condemned by the church, ithad to be pract iced secret ly. In Europe a necromancer might work in a remot e graveyard at night , standing within a magical circle he had drawn to shield himself from the anger of the spirit s. The grave of a person who had died suddenly or violent ly might be plundered for it s body part s; the unused energy these were believed to contain made them valuable in the necromantic ceremony. But body part s aren't essent ial to necromancy, which is now pract iced by channelers, mediums, and shamans, and even by groups of amat eurs sit t ing around a Ouija board.
 
==========necropolis                           A cemet ery, especially  a  large, elaborat e  cemet ery  of  an ancient cit y.


?
 On Sundays the downt own is like a necropolis, and he was always slight ly dist urbed by the complet e absence of life among all those buildings.


With it s -polis ending, meaning "cit y" (see POLIS/POLIT), a necropolis is a "cit y of the dead." Most of the famous necropolises of Egypt line the Nile River across from their cit ies. In ancient Greece and Rome, a necropolis would oft en line the road leading out of a cit y; in the 1940s a greatroman necropolis was discovered under the Vat ican's St . Pet er's Basilica. Some more recent cemet eries especially deserve the name necropolis because they resemble cit ies of aboveground t ombs, a necessit y in low-lying areas such as New Orleans where a high wat er table prevent s underground burial.
 
==========necropsy
   An aut opsy, especially one performed on an animal.


?
 Daisy's sudden death was so myst erious that we paid for a necropsy, and it t urned out she'd been a vict im of lethal chemicals in our import ed dog food.


Human aut opsies are generally performed either to det ermine the cause of death  or to observe the deadly effect s of a disease for research or educat ion purposes. Aut opsies may be necessary when tracking an epidemic; they're also performed to discover whether a death mightact ually have result ed from murder, and if so, what evidence it mightreveal that could help cat ch the murderer. Animal necropsies are act ually more common than human aut opsies, since a farmer with livest ock is always concerned that what ever killed one animal not pose a threat to the others.
 
==========PALEO comes from the Greek palaios, meaning "ancient "-that is, "older than old." The prefix somet imes get s at tached to very recognizable words; paleobiology, for instance, deals with the biology of fossil organisms, paleogeography is the st udy of geography in earlier geological eras, and paleoecology is the st udy of the relat ionship of plant s and animals to their environment in those eras.
 
==========Paleolithic                           Of  or  relat ing to the  earliest  period  of  the  St one  Age, charact erized by rough or chipped st one implement s.


?
 He raves about the health benefit s of his Paleolithic diet , the kind that our pre-agricult ural, hunt ing-and-gathering St one Age ancest ors would have eat en.


Since lithos means "st one" in Greek, the name Paleolithic was given to the older part of the St one Age. The first known period of human cult ure, the Paleolithic act ually covers almostall of human hist ory, from the first use of st one t ools around 2.5 million years ago unt il the invent ion of agricult ure around 10,000 years ago. For almostall that t ime, humans used the very crudest of st one t ools, produced by chipping away flakes of st one in order to make an edge for an ax or knife. Near the end of the period, animal bones and ant lers were being used for t ools, especially point ed t ools, and sculpt ed figures and cave art  were being produced. The Paleolithic gave way to the Mesolithic ("Middle St one Age") period, with it s t ools made of polished st one, wood, and bone.
 
==========paleography
 (1) The  st udy  of  ancient  writ ings  and  inscript ions. (2) Ancient writ ings.


?
 For her thesis on Central American paleography, she spenta wint er in Honduras st udying rock inscript ions 30 miles upriver from the nearest t own.


The world's oldest lit erat ure dat es from about 4,000 years ago, from the land known as Sumer (now southern Iraq). Early writ ing t ook the form of pict ographs, very simple pict ures that firstrepresent ed things or ideas and lat er came to representact ual words. The firstact ual alphabet , in which each charact er represent s a sound, appeared in the same general region about 500 years lat er. But writ ing developed in very different ways in different part s of the world, and 1,000 years lat er, when Europeans firstarrived in the New World, alphabet ic writ ing st ill wasn't being used anywhere in the Americas. Decoding some ancient languages has proven to be a huge task for paleographers, and det ermining the age and the source of a piece of writ ing can pose major challenges.
 
==========paleont ology
      A science  dealing  with  the  life  of  past  geological periods as known from fossil remains.


?
 Her obsession with dinosaurs as a child cont inued through her t eens, and no one was surprised when she start ed graduat e school in paleont ology.


Unt il the 1820s, hardly anyone even suspect ed that dinosaurs had ever exist ed. In the years since, paleont ology has sought to discover the ent ire hist ory of life on earth, from the era of single-celled organisms up int o the human era. Paleontologists cont inue to make remarkable discoveries, such as thata huge met eorit e that fell in the Gulf of Mexico wiped out the dinosaurs-all except the birds, the only surviving dinosaurs. "Radiometric dat ing" can reveal the age (oft en t ens of millions of years) of a rock or fossil or a t iny grain of pollen by measuring how much it s radioact ive element s have disint egrat ed. The st udy of molecules of DNA, RNA, and prot eins has also become important for dat ing. Paleont ologist s oft en consult with geologist s searching for oil, gas, and coal deposit s, since all these "fossil fuels" were formed from plantand animal remains.
 
==========Paleozoic
  The era of geological hist ory, ending about 248 million years ago, in which vert ebrat es and land plant s firstappeared.


?
 His geological specialt y was the beginning of the Paleozoic, from which the earliest fish fossils dat e.


The Greek root zo- means "animal," so names such as Paleozoic were invent ed to refer to a period in the development of animal life. For geologist s, the Paleozoic era is followed by the Mesozoic (meso- meaning "middle"), which is followed by the Cenozoic (cen-  meaning "recent "). Eras are huge stret ches of t ime; geologist s break eras down int o smaller "periods" and "epochs." Thus, the Paleozoic ends with the Permian period, the Mesozoic ends with the Upper Cretaceous epoch, and the Cenozoic ends with the Holocene epoch-the epoch in which we are living. The Paleozoic era produced the first fish, the first land plant s, the first insect s, and the firstamphibians and rept iles; the dinosaurs, birds, and mammals had to wait for the Mesozoic.

==========CIRCU/CIRCUM comes from the Latin circus, meaning "circle." So a circus is tradit ionally held under a round t ent . A circuit can be a t our around an area or t errit ory, or the complet e path of an electric current . To circumnavigate means "t o navigat e around"-oft en around the world.
 
==========circuit ous
 (1) Having a circular or winding course. (2) Not forthright or direct in act ion.


?
 She somet imes arrives ather conclusions by circuit ous reasoning thather st udent s can't even follow.


Circuitous is usually the opposit e of direct, and it 's generally used to describe either roads or explanat ions. Det ours are usually circuit ous, and a circuit ous path, t wist ing and t urning and cut t ing back on it self, is the kind of rout e you'd expect to find in the mountains. Lawyers oft en find themselves making circuit ous argument s, which may get most circuit ous when they're defending part icularly undesirable client s.
 
==========circumference                        (1) The perimet er or boundary of a circle. (2) The out er boundary or surface of a shape or object .


?
 To calculat e the circumference of a circle, mult iply it s diamet er by 3.1416.


At t empt s have been made to measure the circumference of the earth since the t ime of Arist ot le. The calculat ion that Columbus was relying on led him to think he could reach China by sailing west more quickly than by sailing east . But that measurementhad calculat ed the earth's circumference as abouta quart er t oo small, and the rest is hist ory. Columbus wasn't the only one who got it wrong; many lat er at t empt s cont inued to produce different measurement s for the earth's circumference-even though the Greeks had calculat ed  it correct ly way back in the 3rd cent ury B.C.
 
==========circumspect                   Careful to consider  all  circumstances  and  possible consequences; caut ious.


?
 Her answer was careful and circumspect , and I couldn'thelp thinking she knew a lot more than she was t elling.


Since spect- comes from the Latin word for "look," circumspect basically means "looking around" yourself before you act . Being a doct or has tradit ionally called for a circumspect personalit y, which gives their pat ient s confidence in them. Scholars are known for their circumspection, since there's nothing worse for scholars' reputat ions than mistakes in the books or art icles they've writ t en. Bankers once had a reputat ion for great circumspect ion, but the financial disast er of 2008 earned some bankers a very different kind of reputat ion.
 
==========circumvent                       (1) To make a circuitaround. (2) To manage to getaround, especially by clever means.


?
 We knew there was a traffic jam on the highway and circumvent ed it by using back roads.


In mythology, a person's at t empt s to circumvent fat e are almostalways doomed. In the Iliad we're t old of how Achilles' mother, Thet is, hoping to circumvent the prophecy thather child would die in a war against Troy, disguised the boy as a woman. But clever Odysseus, recruit ing for the Greek army, arrived disguised as a peddler, and among the jewels he displayed to the women of the household he laid a sword. The young Achilles, ignoring the jewelry, immediat ely seized the sword, thereby ident ifying himself for whathe was. Today we more oft en hear of at t empt s to circumvent the law, or at least some requirement s that we'd rather nothave to deal with.
 
==========MINI/MINU come from Latin words meaning "small" and "least ." So the minimum is the least , and a minute amount is almost nothing. And mini- is all t oo familiar as a prefix that we've been applying to all kinds of things since the 1950s: minivan, miniskirt, mini-mart, minipark, and the rest .
 
==========minimalism
        A st yle or t echnique (as in music, lit erat ure, or design) that is charact erized by extreme spareness and simplicit y.


?
 He'd never underst ood whatanyone liked about minimalism, since minimalist st ories always seemed to leave outany descript ion of people's charact ers and mot ivat ion and rarely even described their surroundings.


In the 1960s, a few composers, including Philip Glass, St eve Reich, and John Adams, began writ ing music inspired by the music of India and Southeastasia, oft en with a quick pulsing beatand chords thatare repeat ed quickly over and over while small changes are slowly introduced. Minimalistart , which began appearing around the same t ime, tries to strip away all personal element s, oft en leaving only pure geometric forms; you may have seen the plain silver boxes of Donald Judd, or the straight neon t ubes of Bruce Nauman. In lit erat ure, the stripped-down fict ion of Samuel Becket tand Raymond Carver is oft en considered minimalist . But there's a real quest ion whether these various t ypes of minimalism should even be considered the same concept .
 
==========minuscule
    Very small.


?
 For someone who had been living on a minuscule budget since graduat ing from college, even the paycheck for a minimum-wage job felt like wealth to her.


As a noun, minuscule means a st yle of ancient or medieval handwrit ing script  with smaller let t ers than earlier script s. There were act ually several minuscules, but the most important was promot ed from around A.D. 800 on by Charlemagne, who believed thatany educat ed person in the Holy Roman Empire should be able to read the Latin writ t en by anyone else. If you've ever looked ata medieval manuscript , you've probably seen minuscule script , along with so-called majuscule (for modern t ype, we would use the words lowercase  and capital inst ead); even t oday most of us can read medieval minuscule and majuscule without t oo much trouble. Be careful about spelling minuscule; we t end to expecta word meaning "small" to begin with mini- rather than minu-.
 
==========minut iae
Very small or minor details.


?
 She likes "thinking big," and get s annoyed when her job requires her to deal with what she considers minut iae.


As you might guess, this word comes straight from Latin. The Romans used it in it s singular form, minutia, to mean "smallness," and in the plural to mean "trifles"; t oday we almostalways use it in the plural with that same "trifles" meaning. Hardly anyone ever talks about minut iae except to dismiss their importance. So you may talk about the minut iae of daily life or the minut iae of a contract , or about get t ing bogged down or buried in minut iae at the office. Just don't forget that the devil is oft en in the details.
 
==========diminut ive
      (1) Indicat ing small size. (2) Very small.


?
 In German, H?
nsel is a diminut ive form of Hans (which is a diminut ive form of Johannes), and Gret el is a diminut ive form of Margaret .


Justas diminish means "t o grow smaller," diminutive means "very small." When writ ing about language, diminutive as both an adject ive and a noun refers to part icular endings and the words made with them to indicat e smallness. In English, such endings include -etand -ette (piglet, dinette, cigarette, diskette) as well as -ie and -y (doggy, bootie, Bobby, Debbie). However, diminutives are more common in many other languages. Out side of language, diminutive is used for many things, including people ("She not iced a diminut ive figure standing shyly by the door"), but oft en not very seriously ("We were served some rather diminut ive rolls").

==========INTER comes straight from Latin. In  English ithas various meanings; all of them can  be expressed broadly as "bet ween," but they're st ill quit e dist inct : "moving bet ween" (intercity), "communicat ing bet ween" (intercom), "coming bet ween" (intercept), and so on. No wonder so many English words begin with inter-.
 
==========int ercede                          (1) To actas a go-bet ween bet ween unfriendly part ies. (2) To beg or plead in behalf of another.


?
 He had int erceded for her with their boss on one important occasion, for which she was st ill grat eful.


The Latin cedere means "t o go," so "go bet ween" is the most lit eral meaning of intercede. (The same -cede root can also be seen in such words as precede and secede.) If you've been blamed  unfairly  for something, a  friend  may  int ercede  on  your behalf  with  your coach  or t eacher. More oft en, it will be the coach or t eacher who has to int ercede in a st udent disput e. The intercession of foreign government s has somet imes prevent ed conflict s from becoming worse than they otherwise would have.
 
==========int erst ice
A lit t le space bet ween two things; chink, crevice.


?
 All the int erst ices bet ween the rocks have been filled with new cement , and the wall should be fine for another hundred years.


People oft en speak of int erst ices in the physical sense (referring to the int erst ices in surfaces, for example, or microscopic int erst ices bet ween part icles in chemical compounds), butalso oft en in a less lit eral way (the int erst ices in a movie's plot , in the economy, in what 's covered by a complicat ed tax law, et c.). The pronunciat ion of interstice is slight ly unusual; you might not guess that it 's accent ed on the second syllable. This is also true in the plural interstices, which is used more oft en than the singular form; not e also that in interstices the final e is usually pronounced long, so that itrhymes with bees.
 
==========int erdict                    (1) To prohibit or forbid. (2) To destroy, damage, or cut off (as an enemy line of supply) by firepower to st op or hamper an enemy.


?
 All weapons trade with the country had been int erdict ed by the NATO alliance, and ships were act ually being st opped and searched before being allowed to dock.


Interdictand interdiction are used for very serious  prohibit ions-more serious  than, say, a professor t elling the class that t ext ing is forbidden during lect ures. During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, an interdict was a sent ence imposed by the powerful Catholic Church forbidding a person or place, and somet imes even an ent ire country, from receiving church privileges or part icipat ing in church funct ions. Interdict now oft en means "cut off" in a physically forceful way as well; int erdict ions are usually target ed at either arms supplies or illegal drug shipment s.
 
==========int erpolat e
 To put something bet ween other things or part s, especially to put words int o a piece of writ ing or a conversat ion.


?
 On page 6, she not iced that someone had int erpolat ed a couple of sent ences  that complet ely alt ered the meaning of her original t ext .


The meaning of interpolate is oft en ent irely innocent . An interpolation in a t ext may have been approved by everyone  concerned, and  an  int erpolat ion  in  conversat ion  is  usually  just  an int errupt ion. But in it s older meaning, int erpolat ing usually meant tampering with a t ext secret ly to change it s apparent meaning. Legislat ors are somet imes enraged to discover what someone has quiet ly int erpolat ed int o their favorit e bill at the last minut e. And any contractalways has to be read carefully to make sure the other lawyer didn't  slip in an undesirable int erpolat ion.
 
==========SUR is act ually a short ening of the Latin prefix super-, meaning "over, above" (see SUPER), and has the same meaning. A surface is the face above or on the out side of something. A surplus is something above and beyond what is needed. And to survey a landscape is to look out over it .
 
==========surmount
To rise above; overcome.


?
 The st ory of how he surmount ed povert y and crippling physical ailment s to achieve whathe achieved is almost unbelievable.


Our verb mount, meaning "ascend, get up ont o," comes from the same Latin rootas mountain, and we keep those images in mind when using surmount, since climbing up or over a mountain is a symbol of achievement . The word almostalways refers to human effort , and almostalways in a posit ive way; thus, we speak of surmount ing difficult ies, surmount ing problems, surmount ing hurdles, surmount ing handicaps-you get the idea.
 
==========surcharge An addit ional tax or charge.


?
 Checking the bill, she discovered two surcharges that no one had warned her about .


The Arab oil embargo of 1973 led airlines to add fuel surcharges to their passenger fares that were large enough to discourage air travel. Surcharges are usually added for special service. When you requesta "rush job" from a service supplier, it will probably bring a surcharge along with it . A part icularly difficult phone installat ion may carry a surcharge. An extra-large fine for a speeding offense aft er you've already had t oo many t icket s could be called a surcharge. An added tax may be called a surcharge (or surtax) when it  only affect s people with incomes above a certain level. And if those low, low prices that show up in really big let t ers in ads for all kinds of services t urn out to be misleading, it 's probably because they don't include a bunch of surcharges that you won't find outabout t ill lat er.
 
==========surfeit                    A supply that is more than enough; excess.


?
 Whenever he glanced int o his daught er's room, he was always ast onished at the ut t er surfeit of things-dolls, dollhouses, st uffed animals, cushions, games, post ers, and clothing strewn everywhere.


Book and film crit ics oft en use surfeit when complaining abouthow an author or direct or has given us t oo much of something. In our consumer societ y, we're always not icing a surfeit of one thing or another, such as breakfast cereals in the supermarket . Stat ist ics are always indicat ing a surfeit of lawyers or doct ors or accountant s in some part s of the country and a lack of them in others. The death of a young star always result s in a surfeit of art icles and books abouthim or her. And a pot luck supper usually result s in a surfeit of food, which might leave you surfeited, or st uffed.
 
==========surreal                  Very strange or unusual; having the qualit y of a dream.


?
 In a surreal sequence, the main charact er get s a job on floor 7 1/2, which t urns out to be only half as high as the other floors, so everyone must walk around st ooped over.


In 1924 a group of European poet s, paint ers, and filmmakers founded a movement that they called Surrealism. Their central idea was that the unconscious mind (a concept Sigmund Freud had recent ly made famous) was the source of all imaginat ion, and thatart should try to express it s cont ent s. The unconscious, they believed, revealed it self most clearly in dreams. Th e Surrealist paint ers included Ren Magrit t e, Joan Mir, and Salvador Dal , whose "limp wat ches" paint ing became the best -known Surrealist  image of all. Since those years, we've used surreal to describe all kinds of sit uat ions that strike us as dreamlike. And even though the Surrealist movement ended long ago, surrealism now seems to be everywhere-not just in paint ing, lit erat ure, and movies butalso in blogs, video games, and graphic novels.

==========CO is a Latin prefix that generally means "with, t ogether," and we see it daily in such words as costar, cofounder, co-owner, and coworker. But many other co- words aren't quit e so easy to understand when you first encount er them.
 
==========coalesce                         To come t ogether to form one group or mass.


?
 Three local civic groups have recent ly coalesced to form a single organizat ion, believing it will result in more effect ive campaigns.


Social movement s are oft en said to coalesce when groups with somewhat different int erest s realize how much they have in common. Some physicist s believe that planet s coalesced not from space rocks but from icy clouds of cosmic dust . Some people even st udy how languages coalesce-for example, the fairly new language Afrikaans, a mixt ure of Dut ch and nat ive languages spoken in South Africa, which only really solidified about 150 years ago.
 
==========cogenerat ion
         The product ion of electricit y using wast e heat (as in st eam) from an industrial process, or the use of st eam from electric power generat ion as a source of heat .


?
 With it s new cogenerat ion syst em, the company report s convert ing over 65% of the energy in nat ural gas to electricit y, making this the most efficient power plant ever built .


Cogenerat ion is basically the product ion of energy and usable heat (generally in the form of st eam and hot wat er) in the same plant , usually by capt uring heat that in older plant s used to be simply wast ed. It 's one of the principal ways in which countries int end to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions so as to slow climat e change. Cogenerat ion plant s are oft en small, and the fuels used in them are varied. Lumber mills, for instance, can operat e their own cogenerat ion plant s, feeding them with wood scraps and sawdust , and wast ewat er treat ment plant s generat e gas that can likewise be used as a source of energy. Since it 's hard to move heat long distances, cogenerat ion is most efficient when the heat can be used nearby. Though the general public t oday knows lit t le about cogenerat ion, more and more  of  us  will  be benefit ing from it in the coming years.
 
==========codependency
          A psychological condit ion or a relat ionship in which a person is controlled or manipulat ed by someone affect ed with a condit ion such as alcohol or drug addict ion.


?
 She never knew what codependency was unt il her daught er t ook up with a mean, abusive alcoholic and refused to leave him.


Dependency on addict ive substances has been known for cent uries, but the concept of codependency got it s name only as recent ly as 1979. For many of us, codependency isn't easy to understand; we may keep asking "Why doesn't she just leave him?
" and find ithard to accept  the answers we get . Codependents usually don't  share their part ners' addict ion, but their lives t end to be taken over with the burden of caring for and prot ect ing the spouse or part ner. In recent years, people have start ed claiming thatall kinds of condit ions-anorexia, overeat ing, gambling, fear of int imacy, et c.-can result in codependency. Many expert s think all of this has gone t oo far; st ill, almost everyone agrees that spouses of alcoholics and drug addict s face unique difficult ies and should look for supportand advice anywhere they can find it .
 
==========cohesion
    (1)  The  act ion  or  stat e  of  st icking  t ogether.  (2)  Molecular at tract ion by which the part icles of a body are unit ed throughout the mass.


?
 The part y's great est strength was it s cohesion and discipline, and on bill aft er bill that year nota single member vot ed with the other part y.


Cohesion is one of the noun forms of cohere; the others are cohesiveness and coherence, each of which has a slight ly different meaning. Coherence is oft en used to describe a person's speech or writ ing. An incoherent talk or blog post is one that doesn't "hang t ogether"; and if the police pick up someone who they describe as incoherent, it means he or she isn't making sense. But to describe a group or t eam thatalways st icks t ogether, you would use cohesive, not coherent. And the words you'd use in Chemistry class to describe the way molecules hang t ogether-for example, the way wat er forms int o beads and drops-are cohesion, cohesive, and cohesiveness.
 
==========SYN is a Greek and Latin prefix meaning "t ogether" or "at the same t ime." So "in sync" (short for "in synchronization") means "t ogether in t ime." And  a synonym is a word that can be considered t ogether with another word since ithas the same meaning.
 
==========syntax                    The way in which words are put t ogether to form phrases, clauses, or sent ences.


?
 The president 's crit ics complain abouthis odd and confusing syntax when he speaks in public.


Syntax is basically about what word comes before and aft er another word; in other words, it 's part of the larger subject of grammar. Syntax is oft en an issue in poetry, and it 's usually discussed in connect ion with diction-that is, the poet 's choice of words. So, for example, your English professor might point out the syntactic difference bet ween "Whose woods these are I think I know" and "I think I know whose woods these are"; whereas if the discussion was about dict ion inst ead, the quest ion might  be about  the choice of "woods" rather than "land," or "think" rather than "bet ."
 
==========synthesize
  To make something by combining different things.


?
 From all the proposals put in front of us, we were asked to synthesize a plan that could get the support of the whole group.


Synthesize is a very common word in chemistry, since chemist s are constant ly synthesizing new compounds-that is, synthetic compounds-including drugs and industrial chemicals. It 's also oft en used when talking about writ ing; nonfict ion writ ers must oft en synthesize large amount s of mat erial from many sources to produce a book-which represent s a synthesis of the important mat erials. An electronic synthesizercreat es new sounds (which may imitat e the sounds of acoust ic instrument s) by generat ing different basic t ones and then manipulat ing and merging them t ogether with others.
 
==========synergy        The increased effect iveness thatresult s when two or more people or businesses work t ogether.


?
 With the first company's importance in print media and the second's success on the Web, everyone was convinced that the merger would result in an awesome synergy.


An old saying, "The whole is great er than the sum of it s part s," expresses the basic meaning of synergy. The word is somet imes used in a purely physical sense, especially when talking about drugs; somet imes a "cocktail" of drugs may be  more  effect ive than the  sum  of  the effect iveness of each of the separat e drugs. But the word is best known in the world of business. The not ion that , when the right two companies merge, they'll produce a profitable synergy seemed excit ing in the 1990s, when synergy became a trendy buzzword (even though it 's act ually been around since the 17th cent ury). The idea of synergy was one fact or in what became a "merger mania"; unfort unat ely, business synergy oft en t urned out to be harder to achieve than to imagine.
 
==========syndrome                   A  group  of  signs  and  sympt oms  that   occur  t ogether  and charact erize a part icular abnormalit y or condit ion.


?
 When there is no trembling-the most  obvious  sympt om  of  Parkinson's  disease-most doct ors fail to recognize the Parkinson's syndrome.


Combining it s two Greek root s, syndrome means basically "running t ogether." So when diagnosing a condit ion or disease, doct ors t end to look for a group of  sympt oms exist ing t ogether. As long as a set of sympt oms remains myst erious, it may be referred to as a specific syndrome. But if that name is used for a while, it may become the condit ion's permanent name, even aft er an underlying cause has been found. So t oday we have Down syndrome, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Asperger's syndrome, carpal tunnel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, Tourette's syndrome, sick building syndrome, and many more. And since mental condit ions oft en t urn out to have physical causes, syndrome is used in psychology as well as in medicine.

Adonis                         A very handsome young man.


?
 Conversat ion in the lit t le clust ers of girls suddenly st ops whenever this Adonis-blond, muscular, with an athlet e's gait -swaggers down the school corridor.


Adonis, like Narcissus (see narcissism), was a beaut iful youth in Greek mythology. He was loved by both Aphrodit e, goddess of love and beaut y, and Persephone, goddess of the underworld. One day while hunt ing, he was killed by a wild boar. In answer to Aphrodit e's pleas, Zeus allowed him to spend half the year with her and half in the underworld. Today a man called an Adonis probably has strikingly fine feat ures, low body fat , rippling muscles-and a certain vain at t it ude of overconfidence. Adonises should beware; the boar that killed Adonis was sent by either the jealous Art emis (goddess of hunt ing) or the envious Ares (god of war).
 
==========amazon
A tall, strong, oft en masculine woman.


?
 I was greet ed by the t eam's captain, a robust , broad-shouldered amazon who gripped my hand with crushing force.


In Greek mythology, an Amazon was a member of a race of women warriors. One of the famous labors of Heracles (Hercules) was to obtain the sash of the Amazon queen Hippolyta, and the hero Theseus married Hippolyta's sist er. The Amazon River got it s name when, in 1542, the first Europeans to descend the river were at tacked by Indian warriors who, even at close range, they believed to be women. The myst ery of these warriors cont inues to this day. However impressive a figure they cut , though, not every tall and strong woman t oday would take itas a compliment to be called an amazon.
 
==========chimera                      An oft en grot esque creat ure of the imaginat ion.


?
 This lat est piece of legislat ion is a  weird chimera, with sect ions devot ed to agricult ure, defense, welfare, law enforcement , and scient ific research.


In Greek mythology, the Chimera was a fire-breathing she-monst er with a lion's head, a goat 's body, and a dragon's tail, which laid wast e the countryside in southwest ern Turkey. It was finally killed by the hero Bellerophon, whose flying horse, Pegasus, enabled him to at tack from the air. Over t ime, chimera came to be used for any imaginary monst er made up of strange and mismat ched part s; t oday it 's the name of several species of truly bizarre-looking fish. But more commonly a chimera is a fantasy, an illusion, a figment of the imaginat ion, or a dream that will never come true.
 
==========cornucopia
      (1) A container shaped like a hollow horn full of fruit s, vegetables, and ears of grain. (2) An abundance of something desirable.


?
 These books were a cornucopia of wonderful st ories and poems, and as a child I spent count less hours with them.


The Latin t erm cornu copiae meant "horn of plent y," and cornucopia and horn of plenty have both been used in English since the 16th cent ury. Both t erms refer to a hollow goat 's horn, or a wicker basket shaped like one, overflowing with produce from the harvest . The cornucopia has been used as a decorat ive image to representabundance since at least the 5th cent ury B.C., when itrepresent ed a gift given by the infant god Zeus to his beloved nurse: a broken goat 's horn that would always magically be filled with what ever she want ed. In the U.S., cornucopias are oft en seen on altars, in st ore-window displays, and as table cent erpieces, especially atharvest t ime or Thanksgiving.
 
==========Elysium
 A place or condit ion of ideal happiness; paradise.


?
 They had named their estat e Elysium, and as we gazed out over it s fountains, ponds, and sweeping lawns we could see why.


This word came int o Latin from the Greek Elysion. In classical mythology, Elysium, or the Elysian fields, was the home of the blessed aft er death, the final rest ing place of the souls of the heroic and the pure. So it 's easy to see how the word came to mean any place or stat e of bliss or delight . When we try to pict ure heaven, many of us probably see a lovely park; the great boulevard of Paris was named for the beaut iful park that originally bordered it : the Champs- Elyses, or Elysian Fields.
 
==========epicure                          A person with cult ivat ed tast e, especially for food and drink; a gourmet .


?
 He reads trashy novels and wat ches junk on TV, buthe has an epicure's love of fine cheeses and wines.


The Greek philosopher Epicurus was known for his original thinking about the nat ure of mat t er, buthe's bestremembered for his ideas about pleasure as the chief aim of life. By pleasure Epicurus chiefly meant the absence of pain and anxiet y. However, over the years Epicureanism has come to mean a delight in fine sensual pleasures, and t oday an epicure is someone with refined tast e, especially in food and wine. To display your own refined tast e in language, you might try using epicure and epicurean in place of the overused gourmet.
 
==========exodus
A sit uat ion in which many people leave a place at the same t ime.


?
 The war led to a mass exodus of Iraq's Christ ians.


The second book of the Old Testament t ells of the depart ure of Moses and the Israelit es from Egyptand their difficult journey across the Sinai Desert to Mount Sinai, from which they would event ually complet e their journey to their home in Palest ine. The book's original Hebrew name was Shemot , but it 's known to English-speakers as Exodus, from  the  Greek exodos, "depart ure." Leon Uris chose the name Exodus for his powerful novel about the founding of Israel in the years aft er World War I, since the new stat e's post war set t lers had depart ed from many part s of the world for their new home in Palest ine.

TOXI TEN/TENU TECHNI/TECHNO LONG IDIO AER/AERO CAD TRIB WordsfromMythology andHist ory
Quiz30-1 Quiz30-2 Quiz30-3 Quiz30-4 Quiz30-5 ReviewQuizzes30

TOXI comes from the Greek and Latin words for "poison," something the Greeks and Romans knew a good deal about . Socrat es died by taking a solut ion of poison hemlock, a flowering plant much like wild carrot that now also grows in the U.S. Rome's enemy Mithridat es, king of Pont us, was obsessed with poisons, experiment ed with them on prisoners, and tried to make himself immune to them by eat ing t iny amount s of them daily. Nero's mother Agrippina poisoned several of her son's rivals to power-and probably did the same to her own husband, the emperor Claudius.
 
==========t oxin       A substance produced by a living organism (such as bact eria) that is highly poisonous to other organisms.


?
 Humans eatrhubarb st ems without ill effect s, while cat t le may die from eat ing the leaves, which seem to contain two different t oxins.


Long before chemist s start ed creat ing poisons from scrat ch, humans were employing nat ural t oxins for killing weeds and insect s. For cent uries South American tribes have used the t oxin curare, extract ed from a nat ive vine, to t ip their arrows. The garden flower called wolfsbane or monkshood is the source of aconit e, an extremely pot ent t oxin. The common flower known as jimsonweed contains the deadly poison scopolamine. And the cast or-oil plant yields the almost unbelievably poisonous t oxin called ricin. Today we hear health advisers of all kinds talk aboutridding the body of t oxins; but they're usually pret t y vague about which ones they mean, and most of these "t oxins" wouldn't be called that by biologist s.
 
==========t oxicit y               The stat e of being poisonous; the degree to which something is poisonous.


?
 Though they had t est ed the drug on animals, they suspect ed the only way to measure it s t oxicit y for humans was by st udying accidental human exposures.


Toxicit y is oft en a relat ive thing; in the words of a famous old saying, "The dose makes the poison." Thus, it 's possible to die from drinking t oo much wat er, and lives have been saved by t iny doses of arsenic. Even though bot ulinum t oxin is the most toxic substance known, it 's the basic ingredient in Bot ox, which is inject ed int o the face to getrid of wrinkles. With some poisons, mere skin contact can be lethal; others are lethal when breathed int o the lungs in microscopic amount s. To det ermine if a chemical will be officially called a poison, researchers oft en use the "LD50" t est : If 50 milligrams of the substance for every kilogram of an animal's body weightresult s in the death of 50% of t estanimals, the chemical is a poison. But there are problems with such t est s, and t oxicit y remains a very individual concept .
 
==========t oxicology
 A science that deals with poisons and their effect .


?
 At medical school he had specialized in t oxicology, hoping event ually to find work in a crime laborat ory.


Even though most of us are aware of t oxicology primarily from crime shows on TV, toxicologists act ually do most of their work in other fields. Many are employed by drug companies, others by chemical companies. Many work for the government , making sure the public is being kept safe from environmental poisons in the wat er, soil, and air, as well as unhealthy substances in our food and drugs. These issues oft en have to do with quant it y; quest ions abouthow much of some substance should be considered dangerous, whether in the air or in a soft drink, may be left to t oxicologist s. But occasionally a t oxicology task may be more excit ing: for instance, discovering that what looked like an ordinary heartat tack was act ually brought on by a hypodermic inject ion of a paralyzing muscle relaxant .
 
==========neurot oxin
  A poisonous prot ein thatact s on the nervous syst em.


?
 From her blurred vision, slurred speech, and muscle weakness, doct ors realized she had encount ered a neurot oxin, and they suspect ed bot ulism.


The nervous syst em is almostall-powerful in the body: all five senses depend on it , as do breathing, digest ion, and the heart . So it 's an obvious target for poisons, and neurot oxins have developed as weapons in many animals, including snakes, bees, and spiders. Some wasps use a neurot oxin to paralyze their prey so that it can be st ored alive to be eat en lat er. Snake venom is oft en neurotoxic (as in cobras and coral snakes, for example), though it may inst ead b e hemotoxic (as in rat t lesnakes and coppermouths), operat ing on the circulat ory syst em. Art ificial neurot oxins, called nerve agents, have been developed by scient ist s as means of chemical warfare; luckily, few have ever been used.
 
==========TEN/TENU comes from the Latin tenuis, meaning "thin." So to extend something is to stret ch it , and lot s of things get thin when they're stret ched. The ten- root  is even seen in pretend, which once meant to stret ch something outabove or in front ; that something came to be a claim that you were something that you act ually weren't .
 
==========t enuous
  Having lit t le substance or strength; flimsy, weak.


?
 It 's a rather t enuous theory, and the evidence support ing ithas been quest ioned by several researchers.


Something t enuous has been stret ched thin and might  break at  any t ime. A person with a t enuous hold on his sanit y should be wat ched carefully. If a business is only tenuously surviving, it will probably go bankrupt in the nextrecession. If there seems to be only a t enuous connect ion bet ween two crimes, it means the invest igat ors have more work to do.
 
==========at t enuat ed
       Thinned or weakened.


?
 The smallpox shot is an inject ion of the virus in an at t enuat ed form t oo weak to produce an act ual case of smallpox.


A friendship can become at t enuat ed if neither person bothers to keep in t ouch. Radio waves can become at t enuat ed by the shape of the landscape, by foliage, by at mospheric condit ions, and simply by distance. Fact ory workers and rock musicians oft en use noise-at t enuat ing ear plugs to save their hearing. To attenuate something isn't to st op it , just to t one it down.
 
==========ext enuat ing
        Part ially excusing or just ifying.


?
 A good college rarely accept s someone who has dropped out of high school t wice, but in his case there were ext enuat ing circumstances, including the death of both parent s.


Extenuating is almostalways used t oday before "circumstances." Ext enuat ing circumstances are an important concept in the law. If you st eal to feed your children, you're nat urally less guilt y than someone who st eals just to getricher; if you kill someone in self-defense, that 's obviously an ext enuat ing circumstance that makes your act different from murder. Juries will usually consider ext enuat ing circumstances (even when they're instruct ed not t o), and most judges will list en carefully to an argumentabout ext enuat ing circumstances as well. And they work out side of the courtroom as well; if you miss your daught er's performance in the middle- school pageant , she may forgive you if it was because you had to race Tigger to the vet 's emergency room.
 
==========dist ended
   Stret ched or bulging out in all direct ions; swelled.


?
 All the children's bellies were dist ended, undoubt edly because of inadequat e nutrit ion or parasit es.


Before giving you a shot , the nurse may wrap a rubber t ube around your upper arm to distend the veins. When the heart isn't pumping properly, the skin of the feetand ankles may become dist ended. A doct or who not ices thatan int ernal organ has become dist ended will always want to find out the cause. As you can see, distended t ends to be a medical t erm.

==========TECHNI/TECHNO comes from the Greek techne, meaning "art , craft , skill," and shows up in dozens of English words. Some, such as technical, technology, and technique, have long been familiar. Others, such as techno-thriller, were only coined in the current comput er age, which has also seen the new cut -down t erms techno (for techno-pop, the electronic dance music) and tech (for technician or technology).
 
==========t echnocrat
   A scient ist or t echnical expert with power in polit ics or industry.


?
 The new president , a great fan of science, had surrounded himself with an impressive t eam of t echnocrat s.


In 1919 W. H. Smyth coined the t erm technocracy to mean basically "management of societ y by t echnical expert s." Technocracy grew int o a movement during the Great Depression of the 1930s, when polit icians and financial inst it ut ions were being blamed for the economic disast er, and fans of t echnocracy claimed that let t ing t echnical expert s manage the country would be a great improvement . (They  also  suggest ed  that  dollars  could  be  replaced  by  "energy cert ificat es" represent ing energy unit s called ergs.) Today technocratand technocratic are st ill popular words for expert s with a highly rat ional and scient ific approach to public policy issues. But these expert s aren'talways the best polit icians, and when a t errific t echnological solut ion to a problem is opposed by a powerful group or industry, lawmakers find it easier to just ignore it .
 
==========t echnophobe                    One who fears or dislikes advanced t echnology or complex devices and especially comput ers.


?
 The new employee was a middle-aged t echnophobe, who seemed start led every t ime a new page popped up on her comput er screen.


The condit ion known as technophobia got it s name around 1965 (though it s synonym Luddite had been around for a long t ime), and since then we've been flooded with electronic gadgetry. But  even t oday few people act ually understand any electrical t echnology more complicat ed than a light bulb, so there's st ill plent y of t echnophobia around. And it isn't limit ed to comput er users. The explosion of the at omic bomb made t echnophobes out of millions of people; and since human-caused climat e change has been a result of t echnology, it 's not surprising that it  t oo has produced a technophobic response. But if t echnology t urns out to be part of a solut ion, maybe that will change.
 
==========t echnophile One who loves t echnology.


?
 Back in my day, the high-school t echnophiles subscribed to Popular Mechanics, built  ham radios, and were always taking apart the engines of their clunkers.


The word technophile  came  along  soon  aft er technophobe,  which  seemed to need  an ant onym. It s own synonyms include geek, gearhead, and propeller-head (for the charact ers in 1950s comic books who wore propeller beanies to indicat e that they were sci-fi fans). Even before American invent ors began amazing the world with their "Yankee ingenuit y" in the 19th cent ury,  most   Americans  could   be   described   as   t echnology   lovers.  Today,  American technophilia may be seen most  vividly when a new version of a popular video game sells millions of copies to young buyers on the day of it s release.
 
==========pyrot echnic
     Of or relat ing to fireworks.


?
 Her ast onishing, pyrot echnic performance in the concert o left the audience dazed.


You've read about funeral pyres, and you may even have survived a pyromaniac ("insane fire- start ing") stage in your youth, so you mighthave guessed that pyr means "fire" in Greek. Pyrotechnic refers lit erally to fireworks, butalways seems to be used for something else- something justas excit ing, explosive, dazzling, sparkling, or brilliant . The performances of sport s stars and dancers are oft en described as pyrot echnic, and a crit ic may describe the pyrotechnics of a rock guitarist 's licks or a film's camerawork. A pyrot echnic performance is always impressive, but the word occasionally suggest s something more like "flashy" or "flamboyant ."
 
==========LONG comes from Latin longus, which, as you might guess, means "long." The English word long shows up in many compound t erms such as long-suffering ("pat ient ly enduring last ing offense or hardship") and long-winded ("boringly long in speaking or writ ing"), but the long- rootalso somet imes shows up less obviously. To prolong something is to lengthen it , for example, and a chaise longue (not lounge!) is "a long reclining chair."
 
==========longit ude               Distance measured by degrees or t ime east or west from the prime meridian.


?
 Checking the longit ude, she was surprised to see that the t ip of South America is act ually east of New York Cit y.


The imaginary (but very important ) lines of longit ude run from the North Pole to the South Pole. Each is ident ified by the number of degrees it lies east or west of the so-called prime meridian in Greenwich, England (part of London). A circle is divided int o 360; so, for example, the longit ude of the Egypt ian cit y of Cairo is about 31E-that is, about 31 east of London. The "long" sense of the root may be easier to see in some uses of the adject ive longitudinal: A longit udinal st udy is a research st udy that follows it s subject s over many long years, and a longit udinal engine is one that drives a crankshaft thatruns lengthwise under a vehicle (as in rear-wheel-drive cars) rather than crosswise.
 
==========elongat e                         (1) To ext end the length of; stret ch. (2) To grow in length.


?
 When mammals gained the abilit y to fly, it wasn't by means of feathered wings; inst ead, over thousands of years the digit s of their "hands" elongat ed and a web formed bet ween them.


Elongate is oft en found in scient ific writ ing, but the adject ive elongated is more common, and frequent ly used to describe body part s in discussions of anat omy. This was even the case when the superhero Elongat ed Man made his appearance back in 1960. But some other charact ers with the same powers-Plast ic Man, Elast ic Lad, and Mr. Fantast ic-ended up having longer careers.
 
==========longueur                     A dull and boring port ion, as of a book.


?
 She t ells me the book is extremely rewarding, in spit e of some longueurs during which she occasionally drops off to sleep.


Longueur comes straight from French, a language based on Latin. When we borrow a foreign word, it 's usually because English doesn'thave a really good synonym, which is the case here. Longueur is used most ly when talking about books, butalso when describing lect ures and speeches. Like certain other French words, longueur t ends to be used mainly by crit ics and professors-but lot s of us who aren't either could find plent y of use for it t oo.
 
==========oblong                     Longer in one direct ion than in the other.


?
 Their apart ment  was awkwardly oblong, with a long skinny hall running past the cramped rooms.


Oblong is a general but useful t erm for describing the shape of things such as leaves. There's no such thing as an oblong circle, since a stret ched circle has to be called an oval, and any rectangle that isn't square is oblong, at least  if it 's lying on it s side (such rectangles can act ually  be  called oblongs). Pills are generally oblong rather than round, to slide down the throat more easily. An oblong table will oft en fita living space bet t er than a square or round one with the same area. And people are always buried in oblong boxes.

==========IDIO comes from the Greek idios, meaning "one's own" or "privat e." In Latin this root led to the word idiota, meaning "ignorant person"-that is, a person who doesn't take in knowledge from out side himself. And that led to a familiar English word that get s used t oo oft en, usually to describe people who aren't ignorantatall.
 
==========idiom              An  expression  that  cannot  be  underst ood  from  the  meanings  of  it s separat e words but must be learned as a whole.


?
 As a t eacher of foreign st udent s, you can't use idioms like "Beat s me!" and "Don't jump the gun" in class unless you want to confuse everyone.


If you had never heard someone say "We're on the same page," would you have underst ood that they weren't talking abouta book?
 And the first t ime someone said he'd "ride shot gun," did you wonder where the gun was?
 A modern English-speaker knows thousands of idioms, and uses many every day. Idioms can be complet ely ordinary ("first off," "the other day," "make a point of," "What 's up?
") or more colorful ("asleep at the wheel," "bit e the bullet ," "knuckle sandwich"). A part icular t ype of idiom, called a phrasal verb , consist s of a verb followed by an adverb or preposit ion (or somet imes both); in make over, make out, and make up, for instance, not ice how the meanings have nothing to do with the usual meanings of over, out, and up.
 
==========idiomat ic
In a manner conforming to the part icular forms of a language.


?
 The instruct ions for assembling the TV probably sounded fine in the original Chinese but weren't exact ly writ t en in idiomat ic English.


The speech and writ ing of a nat ive-born English-speaker may seem crude, uneducat ed, and illit erat e, but will almostalways be idiomat ic-that is, a nat ive speaker always sounds like a nat ive speaker. For a language learner, speaking and writ ing idiomatically in another language is the great est challenge. Even highly  educat ed  foreign  learners-professors,  scient ist s, doct ors, et c.-rarely succeed in mast ering the kind of idiomat ic English spoken by an American 7th-grader.
 
==========idiosyncrasy
          An  individual peculiarit y  of  a  person's  behavior  or thinking.


?
 Mr. Kempthorne, whose idiosyncrasies are well known to most of us, has recent ly begun walking around t own talking to two ferret s he carries on his shoulders.


Idiosyncrasies are almostalways regarded as harmless. So, for example, filling your house with guns and Nazi post ers might be called something stronger than idiosyncratic. But if you always arrange your Gummi candies in table form by color and t ype, then eat them in a special order start ing with the pt erodact yls (purple ones must die first !), you might qualify. Harmless though your strange habit s might be, they may not be the kind of thing you'd t ell people about ; mostamericans are careful to hide their idiosyncrasies, since our cult ure doesn't seem to value odd behavior. The Brit ish, however, are generally fond of their eccentrics, and English villages seem to be filled with them. By the way, few words are harder to spell than idiosyncrasy-be careful.
 
==========idiopathic
 Arising spontaneously or from an obscure or unknown cause.


?
 Aft er her doct or hemmed and hawed and finally described her condit ion as "idiopathic," she realized she needed a second opinion.


Words with the -pathy suffix generally name a disease or condit ion (see PATH), so you might think idiopathic should describe a disease or condit ion that 's unique to an individual. But the word is act ually generally used to describe any medical condit ion that no one has yet figured out . Most facial t ics are called idiopathic by doct ors, since no cause can be found. Other well- known condit ions, including chronic fat igue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia, st ill perplex the medical communit y. And even though doct ors expect that the causes of all of them will event ually be found, and that those causes will t urn out to be the same for hundreds of thousands of people, the condit ions are st ill called idiopathic.
 
==========AER/AERO comes from the Greek word for "air." The aerospace industry manufact ures vehicles that travel through the at mosphere and beyond int o space. Aerodynamic designs move through the air with maximum speed. And aerophobia is the t echnical name for what we usually just call fear of flying.
 
==========aerial                    (1) Performed in the air. (2) Performed using an airplane.


?
 They're doing an aerial survey of the whale populat ion, which involves scanning the ocean's surface from an airplane.


Shakespeare himself may have coined this word, in Othello, and lat er he gave the name Ariel to the famous air-spirit charact er in The Tempest. An aerialist is an acrobat who performs high above the audience. In paint ing, aerial perspective is the way an art ist creat es the illusion thata mountain or cit y is far away (something that early paint ers only slowly learned how to do), usually by making it slight ly mist y and bluish gray-as if seen through miles of air. An aerial work platform, or "cherry picker," support s a worker ata high elevat ion on the end of a crane. And aerial it self can be used as a noun, meaning a TV ant enna, a forward pass in foot ball, or a high-flying st unt performed by a skat eboarder or snowboarder.
 
==========aerat e                 To supply with air or oxygen.

 The garden soil was well aerat ed, since they had recent ly plowed in all the compost  and manure and even added a box of earthworms.


Faucetaerators and aerat ing showerheads can be easily installed by homeowners to cut wat er (and especially hot wat er) use by as much as 50%. A lawn aerat or removes lit t le plugs of soil in order to letair deep int o the soil, great ly improving the qualit y of soil that may have got t en t oo compact ed. And a pond aerat or, such as a fountain, is a necessit y for an ornamental pond with no stream feeding it , since oxygen in the wat er is necessary to prevent the growth of algae and allow fish to live.
 
==========aerobic           (1) Living or occurring only in the presence of oxygen. (2) Involving or increasing oxygen consumpt ion.


?
 Trainers measure a person's aerobic capacit y by means of the VO 2 max ("maximum volume of oxygen") t est .


Aerobic exercise is exercise that takes an ext ended amount of t ime-usually t en minut es or more-but is usually performed at only moderat e int ensit y. Running, swimming, bicycling, and cross-country skiing are classic aerobic exercises. In 1968 a best -selling book called Aerobics introduced a syst em of exercise for increasing the body's abilit y to take in and use oxygen, and t oday aerobics classes, oft en mimicking such out door exercise as running and bicycling, take place every aft ernoon in thousands of gyms and YMCAs across the country. Aerobic exercise part icularly strengthens the heartand lungs, but usually has many other good effect s as well. Aerobic bact eria, which need oxygen to live, are essent ial for breaking down living mat t er so that itret urns to the soil. They include the famous int est inal E. coli, as well as the staph and strep bact eria that can make a visit to the hospital risky.
 
==========anaerobic
(1) Living or occurring in the absence of oxygen. (2) Relat ing to act ivit y in which the body works t emporarily with inadequat e oxygen.


?
 He's never run a mile in his life, and everything he does at the gym is anaerobic.


In Greek, the prefix a- or an- means "not " or "without ," and bios means "life." Anaerobic sport s and exercise, such as gymnast ics, weight lift ing, and sprint ing, are of high int ensit y but short durat ion, so they don't involve much oxygen intake. Anaerobic exercise triggers a different t ype of cell act ivit y from aerobic exercise. As a result , it doesn't do much for your heartand lungs and it doesn't burn off fat ; what it does do is build muscle. Anaerobic bact eria are bact eria that live without oxygen. They're responsible for several nast y condit ions, including t etanus, gangrene, bot ulism, and food poisoning. They oft en live in deep wounds, so a bad dog bit e-or, even worse, a human bit e-can be dangerous, since the mouth is full of anaerobic bact eria. But mostanaerobic bact eria are harmless, and many are essent ial to our lives.

==========CAD comes from the Latin verb cadere, "t o fall." Thus, a cascade is usually a wat erfall, but somet imes a flood of something else that seems to pour on t op of you: a cascade of new problems, a cascade of honors, and so on.
 
==========cadaver                           A dead body, especially one that is to be dissect ed; a corpse.


?
 The cadaver she was given to work on, from the Manhat tan morgue, was that of an unclaimed homeless woman.


Since a corpse is a body thathas "fallen down dead," the root cad- seems athome here. For most of us, cadaver has an impersonal sound, and indeed the word is oft en used for a body whose ident it y isn't important : most medical st udent s probably don't spend much t ime wondering who they're dissect ing. Someone with cadaverous  feat ures  looks  like a corpse before he or she is dead.
 
==========decadent
  Marked by decay or decline, especially in morals.


?
 The French empire may have been at it s most decadent just before the French Revolut ion.


To be decadent is to be in the process of decay, so a powerful nat ion may be said to be in a decadent stage if it s power is fading. But the word is more oft en used to speak of moral decay. Ever since the Roman empire, we've t ended to link Rome's fall to the moral decay of it s ruling class, who indulged in extreme luxuries and unwholesome pleasures while providing the public with cruel spectacles such as the slaught er of the gladiat ors. But not everyone agrees on what moral decadence looks like (or even how it mighthave hast ened the fall of Rome), though most people think it involves t oo many sensual pleasures-as, for instance, among the French and English poet s and art ist s of the 1880s and '90s called the Decadent s. These days, for some reason, people have decided decadent is the way to describe rich chocolat e cakes.
 
==========cadence           (1) The close of a musical phrase, especially one that  moves to a harmonic point of rest . (2) The rhythmic flow of sound in language.


?
 As the piano came to a cadence, the singer ascended to a beaut iful high not e, which she held for several seconds unt il the piano came in again in a new key.


Most of us hear the ending of a piece of music as a fall to a rest ing place, even if the melody ends on a high not e. And that 's the way endings were being heard way back in the 16th cent ury, when cadence first began to be used in English for musical endings. Most cadences are harmonic "formulas" (standard harmonic pat t erns that we've all heard thousands of t imes) and we don't expect them to be original; so whether you're consciously aware of it or not , a cadential passage is usually quit e recognizable. When cadence means "speech rhythm," it s cad- rootrefers to the way the accent s "fall."
 
==========cadenza              A  virt uosic  flourish  or  ext ended  passage  by  a  soloist ,  oft en improvised, that occurs short ly before the end of a piece or movement .


?
 Each of her arias was greet ed with great er applause, but it was the brilliant improvised cadenza of her final number that brought down the house.


A concert o is a large piece for an instrumental soloist (usually playing piano or violin) and orchestra. Concert os are oft en extremely demanding for the soloist , but the most difficult part of all may be the cadenza, when the orchestra drops out complet ely, leaving the soloist to dazzle the audience with a set of flourishes, oft en complet ely original, right before a movement ends. Cadenzas are also heard in many vocal arias, especially those of the 18th cent ury. The word, borrowed from Italian, originally meant "cadence"; thus, the cadenza, even if it last s for a couple of minut es, is essent ially a decorat ion of the final importantharmonic cadence of the piece.
 
==========TRIB comes from the Latin tribuere, meaning "t o give" or "t o pay." So a group that distributes food passes it out to those in need, and when you contribute to the group you give your money or energy to it .
 
==========tribut e                (1) Something (such as a gift or speech) that is given or performed to show appreciat ion, respect , or affect ion. (2) Something that proves the good  qualit y  or effect iveness of something.


?
 Near the end of his speech, he paid tribut e to the two pioneers in the field who were in the audience.


Tribut e originally t ook the form of things given from a weaker group to the dominant power of a region-a bit like the "prot ect ion money" the Mafia get s from small businesses aft er making them offers they can't  refuse, though the older form of tribut e act ually did buy the weaker group some prot ect ion from enemy forces. Tribut e could come in the form of valuables, cat t le, or even produce, and might include the loan of warriors to strengthen the ruler's army. But when we "pay tribut e" t oday, it 's generally in the form of praise. And when we say, for instance, thata successful school "is a tribut e t o" the vision of it s founder, we mean that it s success is it self a form of praise for the person who founded it . And a "tribut e band" is a rock group int ended to honor a great band of the past .
 
==========tributary
    A stream flowing int o a larger stream or a lake.


?
 The ent ire expedit ion had perished of fever at t empt ing to reach the source of one of the Amazon's great tributaries.


A tributary was originally a person or stat e that owed tribut e to a more powerful person or stat e. Ancient China, for instance, had dozens of tributary stat es, and the emperor would receive elephant s from Siam or young girls from Korea as tribut e. Justas a smaller power gave some of it s wealth to a larger power, a small river contribut es it s wat ers to a larger one. A tributary can be a t iny stream, but some are immense rivers. The Missouri River, for example, could be called a tributary to the Mississippi, even though it 's about 2,500 miles long and receives hundreds of tributaries it self.
 
==========at tribut e                    (1) To explain by indicat ing a cause. (2) To regard as likely to be a qualit y of a person or thing.


?
 He at tribut ed his long life to a good sense of humor and a glass of wine with lunch and dinner every day.


Attribute means something rather similar to "pay tribut e." So, for example, an award winner who pays tribut e to an inspiring professor is, in a sense, at tribut ing her success to the professor. Though if you at tribut e your fear of dogs to an incident in your childhood, you're not exact ly praising the nast y dog that bit you way back when. The second sense of attribute is slight ly different : If you at tribut e bad mot ives to a polit ician, it  means you think he or she is doing things for the wrong reasons (even if you don'thave any proof). When attribute is accent ed on it s first syllable, it 's being used as a noun, usually as a synonym for quality. So, for instance, you may believe thatan even t emper is an at tribut e of the best president s, or that cheerfulness is your spouse's bestat tribut e.
 
==========retribut ion
      Something given in payment for a wrong; punishment .


?
 The vict ims' families have been clamoring for retribut ion, somet imes even int errupt ing the trial proceedings.


With it s prefix re-, meaning "back," retribution means lit erally "payback." And indeed we usually use it when talking about personal revenge, whether it 's retribut ion for an insult in a high- school corridor or retribut ion for a guerrilla at tack on a government building. Butretribut ion isn'talways so personal: God takes "divine retribut ion"  on  humans  several  t imes  in  the  Old Testament , especially in the great Flood that wipes outalmost the ent ire human race. And retribut ion for criminal act s, usually in the form of a prison sent ence, is taken by the stat e, not the vict ims.

==========Words from Mythology and History

halcyon                           (1) Calm and peaceful. (2) Happy and successful.


?
 She looks back fondly on those halcyon childhood days when she and her sist ers seemed to inhabita magical world where it was always summer.


For the Greeks, the halcyon was a bird (probably the kingfisher) that was believed to nest on the Medit erranean Sea around the beginning of wint er, and had the power to quiet the rough December wat ers around Sicily for about two weeks-the "halcyon days." Thus the adject ive halcyon came to mean calm and serene. Today people especially use it to describe a golden t ime in their past .
 
==========meander                    (1) To follow a winding course. (2) To wander slowly without  a specific purpose or direct ion.


?
 A lit t le-used trail meanders through the mountains, crossed by cowpaths ont o which hikers oft en stray and get lost .


Now and then, geography contribut es an ordinary word to the language. The Greek word maiandros came from the Maiandros River (now the Menderes River) in west ern Turkey, which rises in the mountains and flows 240 miles int o the Aegean Sea. Meandering is a nat ural t endency especially in slow-moving rivers on flat ground with fine-grained sand, and the Maiandros was well known for it s many windings and wanderings. Roads and trails, like rivers, can be said to meander, but so can relaxed music, lazy writ ing, and idle thought s.
 
==========oedipal                Relat ing to an int ense emot ional relat ionship with one's mother and conflict with one's father.


?
 Already on her first visit she sensed a t ense oedipal sit uat ion, with her boyfriend and his father barely get t ing through dinner without coming to blows.


In Greek mythology, the king of Thebes, in response to a dreadful prophecy, abandoned his infant son Oedipus, who was then brought up by shepherds. Grown to manhood, Oedipus slew his father almostaccidentally, notrecognizing him, and then married his mother. When the shameful truth was discovered, the mother commit t ed suicide and Oedipus blinded himself and went int o exile. The psychiatrist Sigmund Freud invent ed the t erm Oedipus complex to mean a sexual desire thata child normally feels t oward the parent of the opposit e sex, along with jealous feelings t oward the parent of the same sex. In Freud's theory (notaccept ed by everyone t oday), lingering oedipal feelings are an essent ial source of adult personalit y disorder, and can result in choosing a spouse who closely resembles your father or mother.
 
==========ostracize                           To exclude someone from a group by common consent .


?
 Back in the 1950s she had been ostracized by her fellow country-club members for her radical polit ical beliefs.


In the ancient democracy of Athens, cit izens were permit t ed to vot e once a year to exile anyone who they thought might pose a problem to the cit y-stat e. The man with the most vot es was banished for t en years, even if no one had ever made a single charge againsthim. Vot ing was done on ostraka-bit s of broken pot t ery, the Greek equivalent of scrap paper-and the process was known as ostrakizein. Today the most common kind of ostracism is exclusion from a social group. It can be especially painful in school: no more sleepovers, no more part y invitat ions, just lot s of whispering behind your back.
 
==========paean                   (1) A song of joy, praise, tribut e, or triumph. (2) A work that praises or honors it s subject .


?
 Athis ret irement part y, the beloved president was treat ed to paeans from friends and employees to his years at the head of the company.


Originally in ancient Greece, a paian was a choral hymn to Apollo as the god of healing. More generally, it could be a hymn of thanksgiving, as when, in Homer's Iliad, the followers of Achilles sing a paean on the death of his enemy Hect or. Paeans could be sung at banquet s, at public funerals, to armies depart ing for bat t le and fleet s leaving the harbor, and in celebrat ions of military vict ories.
 
==========philippic                     A speech full of bit t er condemnat ion; a t irade.


?
 Every few days he launches another philippic against t eenagers: their ridiculous clothes, their abominable manners, their ghast ly music.


In 351-350 B.C., the great Greek orat or Demosthenes delivered a series of speeches against King Philip I of Macedon, the so-called philippikoi logoi ("speeches regarding Philip"). Three cent uries lat er, in 44-43 B.C., the greatroman orat or Cicero delivered a series of speeches against Mark Ant ony, which soon became known as the philippica or orationes philippicae, since they were modeled on Demosthenes' at tacks. Splendid though both men's speeches were, Demosthenes was event ually exiled by the Macedonians, and Cicero was execut ed at Mark Ant ony's orders.
 
==========sat yr                   A man with a strong desire for many women.


?
 St ill drinking and womanizing at the age of 70, he likes to think of himself as a sat yr rather than an old goat .


Sat yrs, the minor forest gods of Greek mythology, had the face, t orso, and arms of a man, the ears and tail of a goat , and two goat like legs. Fond of the pleasures associat ed with Dionysus (or Bacchus), the god of wine, they were full of playful and somet imes violent energies, and spent much of their t ime chasing the beaut iful nat ure spirit s known as nymphs. Sat yrs show up over and over in ancientart . The Greek god Pan, with his reed pipes and mischievous delight in life, had the appearance and charact er of a sat yr but great er powers. Not ice how satyr is pronounced; it 's quit e different from satire.
 
==========zealot                  A fanat ical support er.


?
 My girlfriend's father is a religious zealot , so I always find excuses not to have dinner at their house.


In the 1st cent ury A.D., a fanat ical sectarose in Judaea to oppose the Roman dominat ion of Palest ine. Known as the Zealot s, they fought their most famous bat t le at the great fortress of Masada, where 1,000 defenders t ook their own lives justas the Romans were about to st orm the fort . Over the years, zealot came to mean anyone who is passionat ely devot ed to a cause. The adject ive zealous may describe someone who's merely dedicat ed and energet ic  ("a zealous invest igat or," "zealous about combat ing inflat ion," et c.). But zealot (like it s synonym fanatic) and zealotry (like it s synonym fanaticism) are used disapprovingly-even while Jews everywhere st ill honor the memory of those who died at Masada.

UMBR comes from the Latin umbra, meaning "shadow." Thus, the familiar umbrella, with it s ending meaning "lit t le," cast s a "lit t le shadow" to keep off the sun or the rain.
 
umber                    (1) A darkish brown mineral containing manganese and iron oxides used for coloring paint . (2) A color thatis greenish brown to dark reddish brown.


E.g.
 Van Dyke prized umber as a pigmentand used it constant ly in his oil paintings.


The mineral deposit s of Italy provided sources of a number of natural pigment s, among them umber. Since the late Renaissance, umber has been in great demand as a coloring agent . When crushed and mixed with paint , it produces an olive color known as raw umber; when crushed and burnt , it produces a darker t one known as burnt umber.
 
adumbrate                        (1) To give a sketchy out line or disclose in part . (2) To hintat or foretell.


E.g.
 The Secretary of State would only adumbrate his ideas for bringing peace to Bosnia.


A synonym for adumbrate is foreshadow, which means to presenta shadowy  version  of something before it becomes reality or is provided in full. Tough questioning by a Supreme Court justice may adumbrate the way he or she is planning to rule on a case. A bad review by a critic may adumbrate the failure of a new film. And rat s scurrying off a ship were believed to adumbrate a coming disaster at sea.
 
penumbra                      (1) The partial shadow surrounding a complete shadow, as in an eclipse. (2) The fringe or surrounding area where something exist s less fully.


E.g.
 This area of the investigation was the penumbra where both the FBI and the CIA wanted to pursue their leads.


Every solar eclipse cast s an umbra, the darker central area in which almost no lightreaches the earth, and a penumbra, the area of partial shadow where part of the sun is still visible. Penumbra can thus be used to describe any "gray area" where things aren'tall black and white. For example, the right to privacy falls under the penumbra of the U.S. Constit ution; though itisn't specifically guaranteed there, the Supreme Courthas held thatitis implied, and thus that the government may notintrude into certain areas of a citizen's private life. Because it s existence is still shadowy, however, the Courtis still determining how much of an individual's life is protected by the right to privacy.
 
umbrage         A feeling of  resent ment  at  some slight  or insult , often one that  is imagined rather than real.


E.g.
 She often t ook umbrage athis treat ment of her, without being able to pinpoint what was offensive aboutit .


An umbrage was originally a shadow, and soon the word also began to mean "a shadowy suspicion." Then it came to mean "displeasure" as well-thatis, a kind of shadow blocking the sunlight . Umbrage is now generally used in the phrase "take umbrage at ." An overly sensitive person may take umbrage at something as small as having his or her name pronounced wrong.
 
VEST comes from the Latin verb vestire,  "to  clothe"  or  "to  dress,"  and  the  noun vestis, "clothing" or "garment ." Vestis the shortest English word we have from this root , and is the name of a rather small piece of clothing.
 
divest (1) To getrid of or free oneself of property, authority, or tit le. (2) To strip of clothing, ornament s, or equipment .


E.g.
 In protestagainstapartheid, many universities in the 1980s divested themselves of all st ock in South African companies.


If you decide to enter a monastery, you may divestyourself of most of your possessions. When a church is officially abandoned, it 's usually divested of it s ornament s and furnishings. A company that 's going through hard times may divestit self of several st ores, and invest ors are constant ly divesting themselves of st ocks that  aren't  performing well enough. And when it turns out thatathletes have been using steroids, they're usually divested of any awards they may have won.
 
investiture
  The formal placing of someone in office.


E.g.
 Atan English monarch's investiture, he or she is presented with the crown, scepter, and sword, the symbols of power.


In it s original meaning, an investiture was the clothing of a new officeholder in garment s that symbolized power. The Middle Ages saw much debate over the investiture of bishops by kings and emperors. These rulers felt thathigh religious offices were theirs to give as rewards for someone's loyal service or as bribes for someone's future support ; the popes, on the other hand, regarded these investitures as the improper buying and selling of church offices. The investiture struggle caused tension bet ween popes and monarchs and even led to wars.
 
transvestite                           A person, especially a male, who wears the clothing and adopt s the mannerisms of the opposite sex.


E.g.
 In  Handel's  operas,  the  heroic  male  leading  roles  are  t oday  often  sung  by  female transvestites, since he originally wrote them for the soprano range.


Transvestite includes the prefix trans-, "across," and thus means literally "cross-dresser." In the theater, from ancient Greece to Elizabethan England, transvestism was common because all part s-even Juliet -were played by men. Traditional Japanese Kabuki and Noh drama still employ transvestism of this sort . In everyday life, it 's now so acceptable for women to wear men's clothing that the word transvestite is generally applied only to men. The much newer word transgender describes people who think of themselves as having changed sex, or who simply don't believe in the idea that they're either one sex or the other.
 
travesty                   (1) An inferior or dist orted imitation. (2) A broadly comic imitation in drama, literature, or art thatis usually grotesque and ridiculous.


E.g.
 The senat or was shouting that the new tax bill represented a travesty of tax reform.


The word travesty comes from the same prefix and rootas transvestite. Since cross-dressing often isn't  very convincing, the word has usually referred to something absurd. So a verdict  thatangers people may be denounced as a "travesty of justice." Saturday Night Live specializes in dramatic travesties mocking everything from political figures and issues to popular culture-"disguised" versions intended for entertainment . Travesty may also be a verb; thus, Mel Brooks has travestied movie genres of all kinds-westerns, thrillers, and silent films, among others.
 

 
THE/THEO comes from the Greek word meaning "god." Theology, the st udy of religion, is practiced by theologians. Monotheism is the worship of a single god; Christianity, Islam, and Judaism are monotheistic religions, and all three worship the same god. Polytheistic religions such as those of ancient Greece and Rome, on the other hand, worship many gods.
 
apotheosis
     (1) Transformation into a god. (2) The perfectexample.


E.g.
 Abraham Lincoln's apotheosis after his assassination transformed the controversial politician into the saint ly savior of his country.


In ancient Greece, hist orical figures were sometimes worshipped as gods. In Rome, apotheosis was rare until the emperor August us declared the dead Julius Caesar to be a god, and soon other dead emperors were being apotheosized as well. In older paintings you may see a heroic figure-Napoleon, George Washingt on, or Shakespeare, for example-being raised into the clouds, symbolizing his or her apotheosis. But t oday any great classic example of something can be called it s apotheosis. You mighthear it said, for example, that Baroque music reached it s apotheosis in the works of J. S. Bach, or that the Duesenberg Phaet on was the apotheosis of the t ouring car.
 
atheistic
  Denying the existence of God or divine power.


E.g.
 The atheistic Madalyn Murray O'Hair successfully sought the removal of prayer from American public schools in the 1960s.


In the Roman Empire, early Christians were called atheistic because they denied the existence of the Roman gods. And once the Christian church was firmly established, it condemned the Romans as atheists because they didn't believe in the Christian God. In later centuries, English- speaking Christians would often use the words pagan and heathen to describe such non- Christians, while atheist would be reserved for those who actually denied the existence of any god. Atheism is different from agnosticism, which claims that the existence of any higher power is  unknowable; and  lot s  of  people  who  simply  don't  think  much  about  religion  often  call themselves agnostics as well.
 
pantheon                  (1)  A  building  serving  as  the  burial  place  of  or  containing memorials to the famous dead of a nation. (2) A group of notable persons or things.


E.g.
 A Hall of Fame serves as a kind of pantheon for it s field, and those admit ted in the early years are often the greatest of all.


Each of the importantroman gods and goddesses had many temples erected in their name. Butin 27 B.C. a temple to all the gods t ogether was completed in Rome; t wice destroyed, it was ultimately replaced by a third temple around A.D. 126. This extraordinary domed structure is still one of the important sight s of Rome, and the burial place for the painters Raphael and Carracci and two kings. In Paris, a greatchurch  was  completed  in  1789-90; named  the Panth¨¦on, it was announced as the future resting place of France's great figures, and the bodies of Vict or Hugo, Louis Pasteur, Marie Curie, and many others now rest within it s walls.
 
theocracy                       (1)  Government  by  officials  who  are  regarded  as  divinely inspired. (2) A state governed by a theocracy.


E.g.
 The ancientaztecs lived in a theocracy in which guidance came direct ly from the gods through the priest s.


In the Middle Ages, the Muslim empires stretching around much of the Mediterranean were theocracies, and the pope ruled most of modern-day Italy. But theocracies are rare t oday. Modern Iran and Saudi Arabia (and perhaps half a dozen others) are usually regarded as theocratic government s, since, even though Iran's presidentis elected by popular vote and Saudi Arabia is ruled by a royal family, the countries' laws are religious laws. But when a government tries to follow all the teachings of a single religion, things usually don't work out terribly well, so U.S. Constit ution and Bill of Right s forbid using religion as the principal basis for democracy.
 
ICON comes from the Greek eikon, which led to the Latin icon, both meaning "image." Though the icon- roothasn't produced many English words, the words thatis does appear in tend to be interesting.
 
icon        (1) A religious image usually painted on a small wooden panel: idol. (2) Emblem, symbol.


E.g.
 Henry Ford's assembly line captured the imagination of the world, and he and his company became icons of industrial capitalism.


In the Eastern Orthodox church, much importance is given to icons, usually small portrait s on wood-sometimes with gold-leaf paint -of Jesus, Mary, or a saint , which hang in churches and in the houses of the faithful. The Orthodox church favors icons part ly because they communicate direct ly and forcefully even to uneducated people. They are regarded as sacred; some believers actually pray to them, and many believe thaticons have carried out miracles. The common modern uses of icon grew out of this original sense. The fact that Orthodox icons have a symbolic role led to icon being used to mean simply "symbol." Because of the icon's sacredness, the term also came to mean "idol." And once we began to use idol to refer to pop-culture stars, it wasn't long before we began using icon the same way. But for the lit t le computer-deskt op images thatyou click on, the older meaning of "symbol" is the one we're thinking of.
 
iconic                       (1) Symbolic. (2) Relating to a great ly admired and successful person or thing.


E.g.
 The 1963 March on Washingt on was the iconic eventin the hist ory of the civil-right s movement , now familiar to all American schoolchildren.


The original meaning of iconic was essentially "resembling an icon," but t oday it more often seems to mean "so admired thatit could be the subject of an icon." And with that meaning, iconic has become part of the language of advertising and publicity; t oday companies and magazines and TV host s are constant ly encouraging us to think of some consumer item or pop star or show as first -rate or immortal or flawless-absolutely "iconic"-when he or she or itis actually nothing of the kind.
 
iconoclast
  (1) A person who destroys religious images or opposes their use. (2) A person who at tacks set t led beliefs or instit utions.


E.g.
 She's always rat t ling her friends by saying outrageous things, and she enjoys her reputation as an iconoclast .


When the early books of the Bible were being writ ten, most of the other Middle Eastern religions had more than one god; these religions generally encouraged the worship of idols of the various gods, which were often regarded as magical object s. Butin the  Ten Commandment s given to Moses in the Old Testament , God prohibit s the making of "graven images" or "idols" for worship, proclaiming that the Jews are to worship only one God, who is t oo great to be represented in an idol. However, by the 6th century A.D., Christians had begun to create religious images in order to focus the prayers of the faithful. Opposition to icons led to the Iconoclastic Controversy in A.D. 726, when, supported by the pope, iconoclast s began smashing and burning the images in churches and monasteries (clast- comes from the Greek word meaning "to break"). In time, peace was rest ored, and almostall Christians have since accepted depictions of Jesus, Mary, and the saint s. Today an iconoclastis someone who constant ly argues with conventional thinking, refusing to "worship" the object s of everyone else's "faith."
 
iconography
  (1) The imagery and symbolism of a work of art or an artist .
(2) The st udy of artistic symbolism.


E.g.
 Today scholars pore over the advertisement s in glossy magazines, st udying the iconography for clues to the ads' hidden meanings.


If you saw a 17th-century painting of a man writing ata desk with a lion athis feet , would you know you were looking at St . Jerome, translat or of the Bible, who, according to legend, once pulled a thorn from the paw of a lion, which thereafter became his devoted friendE.g.
 And if a painting showed a young woman reclining on a bed with a shower of gold descending on her, would you recognize her as DanaE.g.
, locked up in a t ower to keep her away from the lust ful Zeus, who then managed to gain access to her by transforming himself into golden light (or golden coins)E.g.
 An iconographic approach to art can make museum-going a lot of fun-and amateur iconographers know there are also plenty of symbols lurking in the images thatadvertisers bombard us with daily.
 

 
URB comes from the Latin noun for "city." Our word urban describes cities and the people who live in them. With it s sub- prefix (see SUB), a suburb is a t own "near" or "under" a larger city, and suburban houses are home to suburbanites.
 
urbane                     Sophisticated and with polished manners.


E.g.
 He was remembered as a gent lemanly and urbane host of elegant dinner parties.


Urbane's synonyms include suave, debonair, and especially cosmopolitan. Urbanity was a trait of such classic movie stars as Fred Astaire, Cary Grant , William Powell, Leslie Howard, Charles Boyer, and George Sanders. (Notice that , for some reason, urbane is almostalways used to describe men rather than women.) Teenagers in the 1960s read James Bond novels and watched his character onscreen to get tips aboutacquiring an urbane identity. Butit 's hard to acquire urbanity withoutactually having had wide social experience in sophisticated cities. And, since times have changed, the whole notion doesn't seem to at tractyoung people quite the way it used t o.
 
exurban                      Relating to a region or set t lement  that  lies out side a city and usually beyond it s suburbs and often is inhabited chiefly by well-t o-do families.


E.g.
 Exurban areas typically show much higher education and income levels than closer-in suburbs or nearby rural counties.


With it s prefix ex-, ("out side of," the noun exurb was coined around 1955 to describe the ring of well-off communities beyond the suburbs that were becoming commuter t owns for an urban area. Mostexurbs were probably quiet lit t le t owns before being discovered by young city dwellers with good incomes looking for a pleasant place to raise  their children. Planners, advertisers, and political strategist s t oday often talk about such t opics as exurban development , exurban trends, exurban migration, and exurban voters.
 
interurban
      Going bet ween or connecting cities or t owns.


E.g.
 Businesspeople in the  two cities  have  been  waiting  for decades  for a  true  high-speed interurban railway on the Japanese model.


Interurban is generally used to describe transportation. As a noun (as in "In those days you could take the interurban from Seat t le to Tacoma"), interurban has meanta fairly heavy but fastelectric train, something bet ween an urban trolley and a full-fledged long-distance train, that offers more frequent service than an ordinary railway. Interurban transit t oday may include bus, ferry, and limousine-and, in a few lucky areas, a regional railway. With oil supplies dwindling, there's hope thatinterurban railways will be coming back into wider use.
 
urbanization
      The process by which t owns and cities are formed and become larger as more and more people begin living and working in central areas.


E.g.
 The area has been undergoing rapid urbanization, and six or seven of the old small t owns are now genuine suburbs.


The word urbanization started appearing in print way back in the 1880s, which says something about the growth of American cities. The expansion of Los Angeles was an early example of uncontrolled urbanization. Urbanization is often seen as a negative trend, with bad effect s on quality of life and the environment . Butapart ment s require much less heat than houses, and commuting by mass transitrather than cars can reduce pollution and energy use, and cities offer improved opport unities for jobs (and often for education and housing as well), so city growth doesn't make everyone unhappy.
 
CULT comes from the Latin cultus, meaning "care." So cultivation is care of something, such as a garden, in a way thatencourages it s growth. And culture is whatis produced by cultivating human knowledge, skills, beliefs, manners, science, and art over many years.
 
acculturation
         (1) Modification of the culture of an individual, group, or people by adapting to or borrowing trait s from another culture. (2) The process by which a human being acquires the culture of a particular society from infancy.


E.g.
 The old Eastern European bagel has gone through an acculturation in America, where ithas acquired a soft texture, a white interior, and fillers like eggs and peanut but ter.


Whenever people come in close contact with a population that 's more powerful, they're generally forced to acculturate in order to survive. Learning a new language is usually part of the acculturation process, which may also include adopting new clothing, a new diet , new occupations, and even a new religion. An older generation often fails to acculturate thoroughly, but their children often pick up the new ways quickly.
 
cross-cultural                          Dealing with or offering comparison bet ween two or more different cultures or cultural areas.


E.g.
 A cross-cultural st udy of 49 tribes revealed a tightrelationship bet ween the closeness of mother-infant bonding in a given tribe and that tribe's peacefulness t oward it s neighbors.


If you've ever traveled in a foreign country, you've found yourself making some cross-cultural comparisons: Why are huge family dinners so much more common in Italy than back homeE.g.
 Why  do  Mexican  teenagers  seem to play  with  their  lit t le  relatives  so  much  more than teenagers in the U.S.E.g.
 Cross-cultural analysis has produced extremely interesting data about such things as the effect s of various nations' diet s on their populations' health. Though cross- cultural was originally  used by anthropologist s to refer to research comparing aspect s  of different cultures, it 's also often used to describe the reality that lot s of us face daily while simply walking the street s of a big American city.
 
horticulture
  The science and art of growing fruit s, vegetables, flowers, or ornamental plant s.


E.g.
 He considered majoring in botany, buthas decided instead on horticulture, hoping he can spend more time in a greenhouse than in the library or the lab.


Hortus is Latin for "garden," and the first gardens were planted about 10,000 years ago in whatis often called the Fertile Crescent -the crescent -shaped area stretching from Israel north through Syria and down Iraq's two greatrivers to the Persian Gulf. Probably more fertile in previous centuries than itis t oday, it was the original home of such food plant s as wheat , barley, peas, and lentils or their ancientancest ors (not to mention the ancest ors of cows, pigs, sheep, and goat s as well). Many horticulturists t oday work as researchers or plant breeders or tend orchards and greenhouses-but mostamerican households  contain  at  least  one amateur horticulturist .
 
subculture
 A group whose beliefs and behaviors are different from the main groups within a culture or society.


E.g.
 Members of the emo subculture ather high school recognized each other by their skinny jeans, dyed hair, and canvas sneakers.


This common meaning of subculture (ithas an older biological meaning) only appeared in the 1930s, and for about  20  years  it  was  used  most ly  by  sociologist s,  psychologist s,  and anthropologist s. Butin the 1950s, as America's wealth led to more and more teenagers get ting their own cars and thus their independence, not to mention the arrival of rock 'n' roll, people noticed something unusual happening among young people, and began to speak of the "youth subculture." As the country's wealth and freedom of movement continued to increase, we realized that the U.S. had become home to a large number of subcultures. Today the Web makes possible more than anyone could have dreamed of back in the 1950s. When we happen to st umble on a subculture-bodybuilders, Trekkies, hackers, Airstreamers, anime  lovers, mot ocross enthusiast s-we may realize with ast onishment that we had never even imagined thatit mightexist .
 

 
DEM/DEMO comes from the Greek word meaning "people." "Government by the people" was invented by the ancient Greeks, so it 's appropriate that they were the first to come up with a word for it : demokratia, or democracy.
 
demographic                         Having to do  with  the  st udy  of  human  populations, especially their size, growth, density, and pat terns of living.


E.g.
 Each year the state government uses the most current demographic figures to determine how to distribute it s funding for education.


Demographic analysis, the statistical description of human populations, is a t ool used by governmentagencies, political parties, and manufacturers of consumer goods. Polls conducted on every t opic imaginable, from age to t oothpaste preference, give the governmentand corporations an idea of who the public is and whatit needs and want s. The government 's census, which is conducted every ten years, is the largest demographic survey of all. Today demographic is also being used as a noun; so, for example, TV advertisers are constant ly worrying abouthow to appeal to "the 18-t o-24-year-old demographic."
 
endemic                 (1) Found only in a given place or region. (2) Often found in a given occupation, area, or environment .


E.g.
 Malaria remains endemic in tropical regions around the world.


With it s en- prefix, endemic means literally "in the population." Since the panda is found in the wild exclusively in central China and eastern Tibet , scientist s say it 's "endemic t o" those areas. But the word can also mean simply "common" or "typical"; so we can say that corruption is endemic in the government of a country, that colds are "endemic in" nursery school, or that love of Barbie dolls is "endemic among" young American girls. Don't confuse endemic with epidemic; something can be endemic in a region for centuries withoutever "exploding."
 
demagogue
   A political leader who appeals to the emotions and prejudices of people in order to arouse discontentand to advance his or her own political purposes.


E.g.
 His supporters called him a "man of the people"; his enemies called him a lying demagogue.


Demagogue was once defined by the writer H. L. Mencken as "one who will preach doctrines he knows to be untrue to men he knows to be idiot s," and Mencken's definition still works quite well. The "doctrines" (ideas) preached by demagogues will naturally always be the kind thatappeal direct ly to the ordinary voter, the "common man" or "lit t le guy." Appealing to the common people is notit self a bad thing, butithas often been used by those who calculate that demagoguery (or demagogy) is the easiest way to power. In most countries, fear of demagogic leaders is so strong that voters aren'teven permit ted to vote direct ly for the nation's leader, butinstead vote only for a local representative.
 
demotic                        Popular or common.


E.g.
 Part ly because of television, the demotic language and accent s of America's various regions have become more and more similar.


For many years demotic was used only to describe the writing of ancient Egypt , as the name of the script used by ordinary Egyptians rather than by their priest s. Demotic is still an intellectual word, butit can now be used to describe any popular style in contrast to a style associated with a higher class, especially a style of speech or writing. So, for example, demotic Californian is different from demotic Texan. The most demotic dress t oday is probably blue jeans and sneakers, and those who wear them have demotic taste in fashion. The problem is, in American society it can sometimes be hard to find a style that can't be described as demotic.
 
POPUL comes from the Latin word meaning "people," and in fact forms the basis of the word people it self. So the population is the people of an area, and popular means not only "liked by many people" butalso (as in popular culture) "relating to the general public."
 
populist
 A believer in the right s, wisdom, or virt ues of the common people.


E.g.
 He knew he would have to campaign as a populistin order to appeal to the working-class voters.


The word populist firstappeared in the 1890s with the founding of the Populist Party, which st ood for the interest s of the farmers against the big-money interest s. In later years populism came to be associated with the blue-collar class in the cities as well. Populism can be hard to predict . It sometimes has a religious tendency; it usually isn't very interested in international affairs; ithas sometimes  been  unfriendly to immigrant s  and  blacks; and  it 's  often  anti- intellectual. So populism often switches bet ween liberal and conservative. But the populist style always shows it s concern with Americans with average incomes as opposed to the rich and powerful.
 
populace
 (1) The common people or masses. (2) Population.


E.g.
 Perhaps Henry Ford's major achievement was to manufacture a car that practically the entire populace could afford-the Model T.


Populace is usually used to refer to all the people of a country. Thus, we're often t old thatan educated and informed populace is essential for a healthy American democracy. Franklin D. Roosevelt 's famous radio "Fireside Chat s" informed and reassured the American populace in the 1930s as we struggled through the Great Depression. We often hear about what "the general populace" is thinking or doing, but generalizing about something so huge can be tricky.
 
populous Numerous, densely set t led, or having a large population.


E.g.
 Mostamericans can't locate Indonesia, the fourth most populous country in the world, on a map.


With a metropolitan area of more than 20 million people, Mexico City could be called the world's second or third most populous city. And the nearby Aztec city of Tenochtit l¨¢n was one of the largest cities in the world even when Hern¨¢n Cort ¨¦s arrived there in 1519. But by the time Cort ¨¦s conquered the city in 1521 it wasn't nearly so populous, since European diseases had great ly reduced the population.  Avoid confusing populous and populace,   which are pronounced exact ly the same.
 
vox populi
   Popular sentiment or opinion.


E.g.
 Successful politicians are always listening to the vox populi and adjusting their opinions or language accordingly.


Dating from at least the time of Charlemagne, the Latin saying "Vox populi, vox Dei" means literally "The voice of the people is the voice of God"-in other words, the people's voice is sacred, or the people are always right . Today, by means of modern opinion polls, we seem to hear the vox populi (or vox pop for short ) year-round on every possible issue. But maybe we should occasionally keep in mind that full Charlemagne-era quotation: "Those people should not be listened to who keep saying the voice of the people is the voice of God, since the riot ousness of the crowd is always very close to madness."
 

 
Animal Words

aquiline                          (1) Relating to eagles. (2) Curving like an eagle's beak.


E.g.
 The surviving bust s of noble Romans show that many of the men had strong aquiline noses.


Aquiline, from the Latin word meaning "eagle," is most often used to describe a nose thathas a broad curve and is slight ly hooked, like a beak. The aquiline figure on the U.S. seal brandishes the arrows of war and the olive branch of peace. The word for eagle it self, Aquila, has been given to a constellation in the northern hemisphere.
 
asinine                        Foolish, brainless.


E.g.
 He's not so great when he's sober, but when he's drunk he get s truly asinine.


The donkey, or ass, has often been accused of st ubborn, willful, and st upid behavior lacking in logic and common sense. Asinine behavior exhibit s similar qualities. Idiotic or rude remarks, aggressive st upidity, and general immaturity can all earn someone (usually a man)  this description. If you call him this to his face, however, he might behave even worse.
 
bovine                     (1) Relating to cows and oxen. (2) Placid, dull, unemotional.


E.g.
 In that part of Texas, many of the veterinarians specialize in bovine conditions and won'teven deal with dogs or cat s.


Bovine comes from the Latin word for "cow," though the biological family called the Bovidae actually includes not only cows and oxen butalso goat s, sheep, bison, and buffalo. So bovine is often used technically, when discussing "bovine diseases," "bovine anat omy," and so on. It can also describe a human personality, though it can be a rather unkind way to describe someone. When Hera, the wife of Zeus, is called "cow-eyed," though, it 's definitely a compliment , and Zeus fairly melt s when she turns those big bovine eyes on him.
 
canine                    Relating to dogs or the dog family; doglike.

In the Middle Ages, felines were feared as agent s of the devil, and were thought to creep around silent ly at night doing evil. (Notice that feline is also a noun.)

The leonine strength of Heracles (Hercules) is symbolized by the lion's pelt thathe wears, the pelt of the fabled Nemean Lion which he had slain as one of his Twelve Labors.

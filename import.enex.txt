benediction
A prayer thatasks for God's blessing, especially a prayer that concludes a worship service.




?	The moment the bishop had finished his benediction, she squeezed quickly out of her row and darted out the cathedral's side entrance.




In benediction, the bene rootis joined by another Latin root , dictio, “speaking” (see DICT), so the  word's meaning  becomes something  like  “well-wishing.” Perhaps the best -known benediction is the so-called Aaronic Benediction from the Bible, which begins, “May the Lord bless you and keep you.” An important section of the Catholic Mass was traditionally known as the Benedictus, after it s first word (meaning “blessed”). It was St . Benedict who organized the first Christian monasteries; many Christians have been baptized Benedictin his honor, and 16 popes have taken itas their papal name.

A benefact or may be involved in almostany field. One may endow a scholarship fund; another may give money to expand a library; still another may leave a generous sum to a hospital in her will. The famous benefactions of John D. Rockefeller included the gift s thatestablished the University of Chicago, the Rockefeller Foundation, and  Rockefeller  University.  Many benefact ors have reported that giving away their money turned out to be the mostrewarding thing they ever did.

?	Living in a trailer in near-poverty, she received word in the mail thather father had died, naming her as the sole beneficiary of his life-insurance policy.




Beneficiary is often used in connection with life insurance, butit shows up in many other context s as well. A college may be the beneficiary of a private donation. Your uncle's will may make a church his sole beneficiary, in which case all his money and property will go to it when he dies. A “third-party beneficiary” of a contractis a person (often a child) who the people signing the contract (which is usually an insurance policy or an employee-benefit plan) want to benefit from it .

benevolence	Kindness, generosity.




?	In those financially desperate years, the young couple was saved only by the benevolence of her elderly great -uncle.




Part of benevolence comes from the Latin root meaning “wish.” The novels of Charles Dickens often  include  a benevolent  figure  who  rescues  the  main  characters  at  some  point —Mr. Brownlow  in Oliver Twist, Abel Magwitch in David Copperfield, Mr. Jarndyce in Bleak House, Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. To be benevolent , ithelps to have money, butit 's not necessary; kind assistance of a nonfinancial sort may turn out to be lifesaving benevolence as well.

amicable
  Friendly, peaceful.




?	Their relations with their in-laws were generally amicable, despite some bickering during the holidays.




Amicable often describes relations bet ween two groups, or especially two nations—for example, the United States and Canada, which are proud of sharing the longest unguarded border in the world. So we often speak of an amicable meeting or an amicable set t lement . When amicable describes more personal relations, it may indicate a rather formal friendliness. Butit 's always nice when two friends who've been quarreling manage to have an amicable conversation and to say amicable good-byes at the end.

?	Rebecca quickly became enamored of the t own's rustic surroundings, it s slow pace, and it s eccentric characters.




Computer hackers are always enamored of their new programs and games. Millions of readers have found themselves enamored with Jane Austen's novels. And Romeo and Juliet were, of course, ut terly enamored of each other. But we also often use the word in negative context s: A friend at work may complain that she's notenamored of the new boss, and when you start talking abouthow you're notenamored with the neighbors it may be time to move. (Note that both of and with are commonly used after enamored.)

amorous                          Having or showing strong feelings of at traction or love.




?	It turned out that the amorous Congressman had got ten his girlfriend a good job and was paying for her apart ment .




A couple smooching on a park bench could be called amorous, or a young married couple who are always hugging and kissing. But  the word is often used a bit  sarcastically, as when a tabloid newspaper get s hold of some scandalous phot os and calls the participant s “the amorous pair.” In such cases, we may be encouraged to think the at traction is more physical than emotional.

paramour
 A lover, often secret , notallowed by law or cust om.




?	He had been coming to the house for two years before her brothers realized thathe was actually the paramour of their shy and withdrawn sister.




Paramour came to English from French (a language based on Latin), though the modern French don't use the word. Since par amour meant “through love,” itimplies a relationship based solely on love, often physical love, rather than on social cust om or ceremony. So t oday it tends to refer to the lover of a married man or woman, but may be used for any lover who isn't obeying the social rules.

antebellum                 Existing before a war, especially before the American Civil War (1861–65).




?	When World War I was over, the  French  nobility  found  it  impossible to return to their extravagantantebellum way of life.




Even countries that win a war often end up worse off than they had been before, and the losers almostalways do. So antebellum often summons up images of ease, elegance, and entertainment that disappeared in the post war years. In the American South, the antebellum way of life depended on a social structure, based on slavery, that collapsed after the Civil War; Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind shows the nostalgia and bit terness felt by wealthy Southerners after the war more than the relief and anticipation experienced by those released from slavery. In Europe, World War I shat tered the grand life of the upper classes, even in vict orious France and Britain, and changed society hugely in the space of just four years.

bellicose                          Warlike, aggressive, quarrelsome.




?	The more bellicose party always gotelected whenever there was tension along the border and the public believed that military action would lead to security.




Since bellicose describes an at tit ude thathopes for actual war, the word is generally applied to nations and their leaders. In the 20th century, it was commonly used to describe such figures as Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm, Italy's Benito Mussolini, and Japan's General Tojo, leaders who believed their countries had everything to gain by starting wars. The international relations of a nation with a bellicose foreign policy tend to be st ormy and difficult , and bellicosity usually makes the rest of the world very uneasy.

belligerence
Aggressiveness, combativeness.




?	The belligerence in Turner's voice t old them that the warning was a serious threat .




Unlike bellicose and bellicosity, the word belligerence can be used atevery level from the personal to the  global. The  belligerence  of  Marlon  Brando's  performances  as  the  violent Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire electrified the country in the 1940s and '50s. At the same time, belligerent speeches by leaders of the Soviet  Union and the United States throughout  the Cold War were keeping the world on edge. Belligerentis even a noun; the terrible war in the Congo in recentyears, for example, has involved seven nations as belligerent s.

?	A st udentrebellion thatafternoon in Room 13 resulted in the new substit ute teacher racing out of the building in tears.




Plenty of teenagers rebel against their parent s in all kinds of ways. Buta rebellion usually involves a group. Armed rebellions are usually put down by a country's armed forces, or at least kept from expanding beyond a small area. The American War of Independence was  first viewed by the British as a minor rebellion that would soon run it s course, but this particular rebellion led to a full-fledged revolution—thatis, the overthrow of a government . Rebellion, armed or otherwise, has often alerted those in power that those they control are very unhappy.

PAC is related to the Latin words for “agree” and “peace.” The Pacific Ocean—thatis, the “Peaceful Ocean”—was named by Ferdinand Magellan because it seemed so calm after he had sailed through the st orms near Cape Horn. (Magellan obviously had never wit nessed a Pacific typhoon.)

pacify                        (1) To soothe anger or agitation. (2) To subdue by armed action.




?	It t ook the police hours to pacify the angry demonstrat ors.




Someone stirred up by a strong emotion can usually be pacified by some kind words and the removal of it s causes. Unhappy babies are often given a rubber pacifier for sucking to make them st op crying. During the Viet nam War, pacification of an area meant using armed force to drive out the enemy, which might be followed by bringing the local people over to our side by building schools and providing social services. Butan army can often bring “peace” by pure force, without soothing anyone's emotions.

pacifist                           A person opposed to war or violence, especially someone who refuses to bear arms or to fight , on moral or religious grounds.




?	Her grandfather had foughtin the Marines in World War I, butin his later years he had become almosta pacifist , opposing every war for one reason or another.




The Quakers and the Jehovah's Wit nesses are pacifistreligious groups, and Henry David Thoreau and Martin Luther King are probably the most famous American pacifist s. Like these groups and individuals, pacifist s haven'talways met with sympathy or understanding. Refusing to fightever, for any reason, calls for strong faith in one's own moral or religious convictions, since pacifism during wartime has often got ten people persecuted and even thrown in prison.

pact  An  agreement  bet ween  two or more  people  or groups; a  treaty  or formal agreement bet ween nations to deal with a problem or to resolve a dispute.




?	The girls made a pact never to reveal whathad happened on that terrifying nightin the abandoned house.




Pacthas “peace” atit s root because a pact often ends a period of unfriendly relations. The word is generally used in the field of international relations, where diplomat s may speak of an “arms pact ,” a “trade pact ,” or a “fishing-right s pact .” Butit may also be used for any solemn agreement or promise bet ween two people; after all, whenever two parties shake hands on a deal, they're notabout to go to war with each other.

pace                  Contrary to the opinion of.




?	She had only three husbands, pace some Hollywood hist orians who claim she had as many as six.




This word looks like another thatis much more familiar, but notice how it 's pronounced. Itis used only by intellectuals, and often printed in italics so that the reader doesn't mistake it for the other word. Writers use it when correcting an opinion that many people believe; for example, “The cost s of the program, pace some commentat ors, will not be significant .” So what does pace have to do with peace? Because it says “Peace to them (thatis, to the people I'm mentioning)—I don't want to startan argument ; I just want to correct the fact s.”

CRIM comes from the Latin words for “fault or crime” or “accusation.” It 's obvious where the root shows up most commonly in English. A crime is an act forbidden by the government , which the governmentit self will punish you for, and for which you may be branded a criminal. A crime is usually more serious than a tort (see TORT), a “civil wrong” for which the wronged person musthimself sue if he want s to getrepaid in some way.

criminology                        The  st udy  of  crime,  criminals,  law  enforcement ,  and punishment .




?	His growing interestin criminology led him to become a probation officer.




Criminology includes the st udy of all aspect s of crime and law enforcement —criminal psychology, the social set ting of crime, prohibition and prevention, investigation and detection, capture and punishment . Thus, many of the people involved—legislat ors, social workers, probation officers, judges, et c.—could possibly be considered criminologists, though the word usually refers only to scholars and researchers.

decriminalize
      To remove or reduce the criminal stat us of.




?	An angry debate over decriminalizing doct or-assisted suicide raged all day in the statehouse.




Decriminalization of various “victimless crimes”—crimes that don't direct ly harm others, such as private gambling and drug-taking—has been recommended by conservatives as well as liberals, who often claim thatit would ease the burden on the legal system, decrease the amount of money flowing to criminals, and increase personal liberty. Decriminalization is not the same as legalization; decriminalization may still call for a small fine (like a traffic ticket ), and may apply only to use or possession of something, leaving the actual sale of goods or services illegal.

incriminate
To show evidence of involvementin a crime or a fault .




?	The muddy tracks leading to and from the cookie jar were enough to incriminate them.




Testimony may incriminate a suspect by placing him at the scene of a crime, and incriminating evidence is the kind that strongly links him to it . But the word doesn'talways refer to an actual crime. We can say, for instance, thata virus has been incriminated as the cause of a type of cancer, or that video games have been incriminated in the decline in st udy skills among young people.

recrimination
  (1) An accusation in answer to an accusation made against oneself. (2) The making of such an accusation.




?	Their failure to find help led to endless and point less recriminations over responsibility for the accident .




Defending oneself from a verbal at tack by means of a counterat tack is as natural as physical self-defense. So a disaster often brings recriminations among those connected with it , and divorces and child-cust ody bat t les usually involve recriminations bet ween husband and wife. An actual crime isn't generally involved, butit may be; when two suspect s startexchanging angry recriminations after they've been picked up, it often leads to one of them turning against  the other in court .

PROB comes from the Latin words for “prove or proof” and “honesty or integrity.” A probe, whether it 's a lit t le object for testing electrical circuit s or a spacecraftheaded for Mars, is basically something that 's looking for evidence or proof. And probable  originally  described something that wasn't certain but might be “provable.”

approbation
 A formal or official act of approving; praise, usually given with pleasure or enthusiasm.




?	The senate signaled it s approbation of the new plan by voting for it unanimously.




Approbation is a noun form of approve, butapprobation is usually stronger than mere approval. An official commendation for bravery is an example of approbation; get ting reelected to office by a wide margin indicates public approbation; and the social approbation received by a star quarterback in high school usually makes all the pain worthwhile.

probate                 The process of proving in court that the will of someone who has died is valid, and of administering the estate of a dead person.




?	When her father died, she thought she would be able to avoid probate, but she wasn't that lucky.




Ever since people have writ ten wills, those wills have had to be proven genuine by a judge. Withouta probate process, greedy acquaintances or relatives could write up a fake will stating thatall the person's wealth belonged to them. To establish a will as genuine, it must generally be wit nessed and stamped by someone officially licensed to do  so  (though  wills  have sometimes been approved even when they were just writ ten on a piece of scrap paper, with no wit nesses). Today we use probate more broadly to mean everything that 's handled in probate court, a special court that oversees the handling of estates (the money and property left when someone dies), making sure thateveryone eventually receives whatis properly theirs.

?	Her unquestioned probity helped win her the respect of her fellow judges.




Probity is a quality the public generally hopes for in it s elected officials but doesn'talways get . Bankers, for example, have traditionally been careful to projectan air of probity, even though banking scandals and bailout s have made this harder than ever. An aura of probity surrounds such public figures as Warren Buffet tand Bill Moyers, men to whom many Americans would entrust their children and their finances.

reprobate
 A person of thoroughly bad character.




?	His wife finally lefthim, claiming he was a reprobate who would disappear for weeks ata time, gambling and drinking away all his money.




The related verb of reprobate is reprove, which originally, as the opposite of approve, meant “to condemn.” Thus, a reprobate, as the word was used in Biblical translations, was someone condemned to hell. But for many years reprobate has been said in a t one of joshing affection, usually to describe someone of doubt ful morals but good humor.  Shakespeare's  greatcharacter Falstaff—a lazy, lying, boast ful, sponging drunkard—is the model of a reprobate, but still everyone's favorite Shakespeare character.

GRAV comes from the Latin word meaning “heavy, weighty, serious.” Gravity is, of course, what makes things heavy, and withoutit there wouldn't be any life on earth, since nothing would stay on earth atall. This doesn't st op us from yelling in outrage when the familiar laws of gravity cause something to drop to the floor and break.

grave               (1) Requiring serious thought or concern. (2) Serious and formal in appearance or manner.




?	We realized that the situation was grave and that the slightestincident could spark all-out war.




Gravity has a familiar physical meaning butalso a nonphysical meaning—basically “seriousness.” Thus, something grave possesses gravity. You can refer to the gravity of a person's manner, though public figures t oday seem to have a lot less gravity than they used to have. Or you can talk abouta grave situation, as in the example sentence. Buteven though Shakespeare makes a pun on grave when a dying character talks about being buried the next day (“Ask for me t omorrow and you shall find me a grave man”), the word meaning “hole for burying a body” isn'tactually related.

gravitas
 Great or very dignified seriousness.




?	The head of the commit tee never failed to carry herself with the gravitas she felt was appropriate to her office.




This word comes to us straight from Latin. Among the Romans, gravitas was thought to be essential to the character and functions of any adult (male) in authority. Even the head of a household or a low-level official would strive for this important quality. We use gravitas t oday to identify the same solemn dignity in men and women, butit seems to come easier in those who are over 60, slow-moving—and a bit overweight .

gravitate
  To move or be drawn t oward something, especially by natural tendency or as if by an invisible force.




?	On hotevenings, the t own's social life gravitated t oward the lakefront , where you could stroll the long piers eating ice cream or dance at the old Casino.




To gravitate is to respond, almost  unconsciously, to a force that  works like gravity to draw things steadily to itas if by their own weight . Thus, young people gravitate t oward a role model, moths gravitate to a flame, a conversation might gravitate t oward politics, and everyone ata party often gravitates to the bar.

?	She went back to the soccer team before the knee was completely healed, which naturally aggravated the injury.




Since the grav- root  means basically “weighty or serious,” the original meaning of aggravate was “to make more serious.” A bad relationship with your parent s can be aggravated by marrying someone who nobody likes, for example, or a t ouchy trade relationship bet ween two countries can be aggravated by their inability to agree on climate-change issues. Depression can be aggravated by insomnia—and insomnia can be aggravated by depression. But when most people use aggravate t oday, they employ it s “annoy” sense, as in  “What  really aggravates my dad is having to listen to that TV all day long.”

LEV comes from the Latin adjective levis, meaning “light ,” and the verb levare, meaning “to raise or lighten.” So a lever is a bar used to lift something, by means of leverage. And levitation is the magician's trick in which a body seems to rise into the air by it self.

alleviate
To lighten, lessen, or relieve, especially physical or mental suffering.




?	Cold compresses alleviated the pain of the physical injury, but only time could alleviate the effect of the insult .




Physical pain or emotional anguish, or a water shortage or traffic congestion, can all be alleviated by providing the appropriate remedy. But some pain or anguish or shortage or congestion will remain: to alleviate is not to cure.

cantilever                         A long piece of wood, metal, et c., that sticks out from a wall to support something above it .




?	The house's deck, supported by cantilevers, jut ted out dramatically over the rocky slope, and looking over the edge made him dizzy.




Cantilevers hold up a surface or room without themselves being supported at their outer end. Many out door balconies are cantilevered, and theater balconies may be as well. A cantilevered bridge may have a huge span (as long as 1,800 feet ) built out on either side of a single large foundation pier. Architect s sometimes use cantilevered construction to produce  dramatic effect s; Frank Lloyd Wright 's “Fallingwater” house, which extends out over a rocky river, is a famous example. But the Grand Canyon's “Skywalk” has become perhaps the best -known piece of cantilevered construction in America.

levity                      Lack of appropriate seriousness.




?	The Puritan elders tried to ban levity of all sort s from the community's meetings, but found itincreasingly difficult to control the younger generation.




Levity originally was thought to be  a physical force exact ly like gravity but pulling  in the opposite direction, like the helium in a balloon. As recent ly as the 19th century, scientist s were still arguing aboutit s existence. Today levity refers only to light ness in manner. To stern believers of some religious faiths, levity is often regarded as almost sinful. But the word, like it s synonym frivolity, now has an old-fashioned ring to itand is usually used only half-seriously.

Words from Mythology and History


cicerone                   A  guide,  especially  one  who  takes  t ourist s to museums, monument s, or architectural sites and explains whatis being seen.




?	On Crete they sought outa highly recommended cicerone, hoping to receive the best possible introduction to the noteworthy hist orical sites.




The Roman statesman and orat or Cicero was renowned for his elegant style and great knowledge (and occasional long-windedness). So 18th-century Italians seem to have given the name cicerone to the guides who would show well-educated foreigners around the great cultural sites of the ancientroman empire—guides who sought to be as eloquentand informed as Cicero in explaining the world in which he lived.

hect or                      To bully or harass by bluster or personal pressure.




?	He would swagger around the apart mententrance with his friends and hect or the terrified inhabitant s going in and out .




In Homer's great Iliad, Hect or was the leader of the Trojan forces, and the very model of nobility and honor. In the Greek war against Troy, he killed several great warriors before being slain by Achilles. His name began to take on it s current meaning only after gangs of bullying young rowdies, many of them armed soldiers recent ly released from service following the end of the English Civil War, began terrorizing the resident s of late-17th-century London. The gangs t ook such names as the Roysters, the Blades, the Bucks, and the Bloods, but the best - known of them was called the Hect ors. The names Blades and Hect ors may have seemed appropriate because, like Hect or and Achilles, they often fought with swords.

hedonism                     An at tit ude or way of life based on the idea that pleasure or happiness should be the chief goal.




?	In her new spirit of hedonism, she went out for a massage, picked up champagne and chocolate truffles, and made a date thatevening with an old boyfriend.




Derived from the Greek word for “pleasure,” hedonism over the ages has provided the basis for several philosophies. The ancient Epicureans and the 19th-century Utilitarians both taughtand pursued hedonistic principles. Butalthough we generally use the word t oday when talking aboutimmediate pleasures for the senses, philosophers who talk abouthedonism are usually talking about quiet pleasures thataren't pursued in a selfish way.

?	The guest of honor was a nest or among journalist s, and after dinner he shared some of his wisdom with the audience.




Nest or was another character from the Iliad, the eldest of the Greek leaders in the Trojan War. A great warrior as a young man, he was now noted for his wisdom and his talkativeness, both of which increased as he aged. These days, a nest or is not necessarily long-winded, but merely wise and generous with his advice.

spartan	Marked by simplicity, avoidance of luxury, and often strict self-discipline or self-denial.




?	When he was single, he had lived a spartan life in a tiny, undecorated apart ment with one chair, a table, and a bed.




In ancient times, the Greek city-state of Sparta had a reputation for the severe and highly disciplined way of life itenforced among it s citizens, so as to keep them ready for war atany time. Physical training was required for both men and women. A boy would begin his military  training at 7 and would live in army barracks for much of his life, even after he was married. Today, when a cargo ship or a remote beach resort offers “spartan accommodations,” some  t ourist s jump at the chance for a refreshing change from the luxuries they've been used t o— and no one worries that they'll be forced out of bed at dawn to participate in war games.

stent orian
Extremely loud, often with especially deep richness of sound.




?	Even withouta microphone, his stent orian voice was clearly audible in the lastrows of the audit orium.




Stent or, like Hect or, was a warrior in the Iliad, but on the Greek side. His unusually powerful voice (Homer calls him “brazen-voiced”—thatis, with a voice like a brass instrument ) made him the natural choice for delivering announcement s and proclamations to the assembled Greek army, in an era when there was no way of artificially increasing the volume of a voice.

stoic                  Seemingly indifferent to pleasure or pain.




?	She bore the pain of her broken leg with such stoic patience that most of us had no idea she was suffering.




The Stoics were members of a philosophical movement that firstappeared in ancient Greece and  lasted  well  into  the  Roman  era. Stoicism  taught  that  humans  should  seek to free themselves from joy, grief, and passions of all kinds in order to at tain wisdom; it s teachings thus have much in common with Buddhism. The great St oics include the statesman Cicero, the playwright Seneca, and the emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose Meditations is the most famous book of St oic philosophy. Today we admire the kind of stoicism thatenables some people (who may never have even heard of Marcus Aurelius) to endure both mental and physical pain without complaint .

sybaritic	Marked by a luxurious or sensual way of life.




?	When I knew them they were living a sybaritic existence—hopping from resort to resort , each more splendid than the last —buta year later the money ran out .




The ancient city of Sybaris (near modern Terranova di Sibari), founded by the Greeks on the  t oe of Italy's “boot ,” was famous for the wealth and luxury of it s citizens in the 6th century B.C. But the Sybarites' wealth made them overconfident , and when they went to war with a nearby city, they were defeated by a much smaller army. After the vict ory, their enemies diverted the course of the river running through Sybaris so thatit destroyed the whole city forever.

Quiz8-1 Quiz8-2 Quiz8-3 Quiz8-4 Quiz8-5 ReviewQuizzes8

PORT comes from the Latin verb portare, meaning "to carry." Thus, something portable can be carried around. A porter carries your luggage, whether through a train station or high into the Himalayas. When we transport something, we have it carried from one place to another. And goods for exportare carried away to another country.
 
portage               The  carrying  of  boat s  or goods  overland  from one  body  of  water to another; also, a regular route for such carrying.


E.g.
 The only portage on the whole canoe route would be the one around the great waterfall on our second day.


Portage was borrowed from French back in the 15th century to mean "carrying, transporting" or "freight ," and ithas keptit s simple "carrying" sense to the present day. Butit s first known use in it s "carrying of boat s" sense came in 1698, and the obstacle that the canoes couldn't be steered over was none other than Niagara Falls. Though canoes are much lighter t oday than they used to be, a long portage thatincludes a lot of camping gear can still testa camper's strength.
 
port folio                        (1) A  flat  case  for  carrying  document s  or  art works. (2)  The invest ment s owned by a person or organization.


E.g.
 In those days, a graphic artist who had recent ly moved to New York would just schlep his port folio around to every magazine office in the city.


Portfolio is part ly based on the Latin folium, meaning "leaf, sheet ." A port folio usually represent s a portable showcase of your talent s. Today actual port folios are used less than they used to be by artist s, since most commercial artist s have a Web site dedicated to showing off their art . But portfolio in it s other common meaning is extremely common. Not so long ago, a broker would keep each of his or her client s' invest ment s in a separate notebook or port folio. Today the invest ment port folio, like an artist 's port folio, usually takes the form of a Web page, even though everyone still uses the same old word.
 
comport                          (1) To be in agreement with. (2) To behave.


E.g.
 This new evidence comport s with everything we know about whathappened that night .


With it s prefix com-, "with," the Latin word comportare meant "to bring t ogether." So it 's easy to see how in English we could say thata college's policy comport s with state law, or thata visit to your parent s doesn't comport with your other weekend plans, or thatyour auntand uncle won't listen to anything on TV that doesn't comport with their prejudices. The "behave" sense of the word comes through French, and it s essential meaning is how a person "carries" him- or herself. So you may say, for instance, thatyour 17-year-old comported himself well (for once!) at the wedding reception, or thatan ambassador always comport s herself with dignity-thatis, her comportmentis always dignified-or thatyour class comported it self in a way that was a credit to the school.
 
deport ment
     Manner of conducting oneself socially.


E.g.
 At social event s she would constant ly sneak glances atalexandra, in quietadmiration of her elegantand graceful deport ment .


We've all seen pictures of girls walking around balancing books on their heads in an effort to achieve the poise of a princess or a film star. Classes in deport ment were once a standard part of a young lady's upbringing, offered in all the girls' colleges; and you can still take private deport ment classes, where you'll learn about  posture and body language, how to move, sit , stand, shake hands, dress, drink and eat , and much more. But deport mentisn'tall aboutrefined female grace. In fact , deportis often used as a synonym for comport, but usually in a positive way; thus, people are often said to deport themselves well, confident ly, with dignity, like gent lemen or ladies, and so on.
 
PEND comes from the Latin verb pendere, meaning "to hang" or "to weigh." (In the Roman era, weighing something large often required hanging it from a hook on one side of the balance scales.) We find the rootin English words like appendix,  referring to that  useless  and sometimes troublesome t ube thathangs from the intestine, or that section at the back of some books that might contain some useful additional information.
 
pendant                          Something thathangs down, especially as an ornament .


E.g.
 Around her neck she was wearing the antique French pendanthe had given her, with it s three rubies setin silver filigree.


Most pendant s are purely decorative. Buta pendant may also hold a picture or a lock of hair of a lover or a child. And, perhaps because they hang protectively in front of the body and near the heart , pendant s have often had symbolic and magical purposes. Thus, a pendant may be a charm or amulet , or it s gems or metals may  be  felt to have  health-giving  properties. In architecture, a pendantis an ornament thathangs down from a structure, but unlike a necklace pendantit 's usually solid and inflexible.
 
append                     To add as something extra.


E.g.
 She appended to the memo a list of the specific items that the school was mostin need of.


Append is a somewhat formal word. Lawyers, for example, often speak of appending items to other document s, and lawmakers frequent ly append small bills to big ones, hoping thateveryone will be paying at tention only to the main part of the big bill and won't notice. When we append a small separate section to the end of a report or a book, we call itan appendix. Butin the early years of e-mail, the words we decided on were attach and attachment, probably because appendixes are thought of as unimportant , whereas the at tachmentis often the whole reason for sending an e-mail.
 
appendage                         (1) Something joined on to a larger or more important body or thing.
(2) A secondary body part , such as an arm or a leg.


E.g.
 She often complained that she felt like a mere appendage of her husband when they socialized with his business part ners.


Appendix isn't the only noun that comes from append. Unlike appendix, appendage doesn't suggest the end of something, but simply something at tached. The word is often used in biology to refer to part s of an animal's body: an insect 's antennae, mouthpart s, or wings, for example. The appendages of some animals will grow  back after they've been removed; a salamander, for example, can regrow a finger, and the tiny sea squirt can regrow all it s appendages-and even it s brain.
 
suspend                     (1) To st op something, or to force someone to give up some right or position, for a limited time. (2) To hang something so thatitis free on all sides.


E.g.
 The country has been suspended from the major trade organizations, and the effect s on it s economy are beginning to be felt .


When something is suspended, itis "lefthanging"; itis neither in full operation nor permanent ly ended. Suspense is a state of uncertainty and maybe anxiety. When we watch a play or movie, we enjoy experiencing a "suspension of disbelief"; thatis, we allow ourselves to believe we're watching reality, even though we aren't truly fooled.Suspension can also mean physical hanging; thus, in a suspension bridge, the roadway actually hangs from huge cables. When some substance is "in suspension," it s particles are "hanging" in another substance, mixed into it but notactually dissolved, like fine sand in water, or sea spray in the air at the seashore.
 

 
PAN comes from a Greek word meaning "all"; as an English prefix, it  can  also  mean "completely," "whole," or "general." A panoramic view is a complete view in every direction. A pantheon is a temple dedicated to all the gods of a religion. A pandemic out break of a disease may notaffect the entire human population, butenough to produce a catastrophe.
 
panacea
   A remedy for all ills or difficulties; cure-all.


E.g.
 Educational reform is sometimes viewed as the panacea for all of society's problems.


Panacea comes from a Greek word meaning "all-healing," and Panacea was the goddess of healing. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, alchemist s who sought to concoct the "elixir of life" (which would give eternal life) and the "philosopher's st one" (which would turn ordinary metals into gold) also labored to find the panacea. But no such medicine was ever found, justas no solution to all of a society's difficulties has ever been found. Thus, panacea is almostalways used to criticize the very idea of a t otal solution ("There's no panacea for the current problems plaguing Wall Street ").
 
pandemonium
            A wild uproar or commotion.


E.g.
 Pandemonium erupted in the stadium as the ball shot past the goalie into the net .


In John Milt on's Paradise Lost, the fallen Satan has his heralds proclaim "A solemn Councel forthwith to be held / At Pandaemonium, the high Capital / Of Satan and his Peers." Milt on got  the name for his capital of hell, where Satan gathered t ogether all his demons, by linking pan with the Latin word daemonium, "evil spirit ." For later writers, pandemonium became a synonym for hell it self, since hell was then often seen as a place of constant noise and confusion, butalso for any wicked and lawless place. Nowadays it 's used to refer to the uproar it self rather than the place where it occurs.
 
pantheism
  A system of belief thatregards God as identical with the forces and laws of the universe.


E.g.
 Most of her st udent s seemed to accepta vague kind of pantheism, withoutany real belief that God had ever appeared in human form.


Pantheistic ideas-and mostimportant ly the belief that God is equal to the universe, it s physical mat ter, and the forces that govern it -are found in the ancient books of Hinduism, in the works of many Greek philosophers, and in later works of philosophy and religion over the centuries. Much modern New Age spirituality is pantheistic. But most Christian thinkers reject pantheism because it makes God t oo impersonal, doesn'tallow for any difference bet ween the creation and the creat or, and doesn't seem to allow for humans to make meaningful moral choices.
 
panoply            (1) A magnificent or impressive array. (2) A display of all appropriate accessory items.


E.g.
 The full panoply of a royal coronation was a thrilling sight for the throngs of sidewalk onlookers and the millions of television viewers.


The fully armed Greek soldier was an impressive sight , even if Greek armor never became as heavy as that of medieval knight s on horseback (who couldn't possibly have marched in such out fit s). Panoplia was  the Greek  word for the full suit of armor, and the English panoply originally likewise referred to the full suit of armor worn by a soldier or knight . Today panoply may refer to full ceremonial dress or lavish ceremonial decoration of any kind. And it can also refer to striking spectacle of almostany kind: the breathtaking panoply of aut umn foliage, or the stirring panoply of a military parade, for example.
 
EXTRA is Latin for "out side" or "beyond." So anything extraterrestrial or extragalactic takes place beyond the earth or the galaxy. Something extravagant, such as an extravaganza, goes way beyond the normal. And extra is naturally a word it self, a shortening of extraordinary, "beyond the ordinary."
 
extradite To deliver an accused criminal from one place to another where the trial will be held.


E.g.
 Picked up by the Colorado police for burglary, he's being extradited to Mississippi to face trial for murder.


Extradition from one state to another is generally a straight forward process. Butextradition may become more complicated when two countries are involved, even though most countries have  signed  treaties stating  that  they will send  criminals to the  country where  they are wanted. Many  countries  often  won't  send  their own  citizens to another country  for trial; countries that don't permit the death penalty may notagree to send a suspect back to face such a penalty; and most countries won'textradite someone accused of political crimes. When extradition seems unlikely, a country may actually kidnap someone from another country, but  this is illegal and rare.
 
extrapolate                           To extend or project fact s or data into an area not known in order to make assumptions or to predict fact s or trends.


E.g.
 Economist s predict future buying trends part ly by extrapolating from currenteconomic data.


Scientist s worry about the greenhouse effect because they have extrapolated the rate of carbon-dioxide buildup and predicted thatit s effect on the at mosphere will become increasingly severe. On the basis of their extrapolations, they have urged government s and businesses to limit fact ory and aut omobile emissions. Notice thatit 's acceptable to speak of extrapolating existing data (to produce new data), extrapolating from existing data (to produce new data), or extrapolating new data (from existing data)-in other words, itisn'teasy to use this word wrong.
 
extrovert                      A person mainly concerned with things out side him- or herself; a sociable and out going person.


E.g.
 These parties are always full of loud extrovert s, and I always find myself hiding in a corner with my drink.


Extrovert  (sometimes  spelled extravert)  means  basically  "turned  out ward"-that  is, t oward things out side oneself. The word was coined by the eminent psychologist C. G. Jung in the early 20th century. The opposite personality type, in Jung's view, was the introvert. Extrovert s seem to be favored by societies such as ours, even though introvert s seem to be on average more mentally gifted. Psychologist s have said that the only personality trait s that can be identified in newborn infant s are shyness and lack of shyness, which are fairly close t o-but notreally the same as-introversion and extroversion.
 
extraneous                           (1) Existing or coming from the out side. (2) Not forming an essential part ; irrelevant .


E.g.
 Be sure your essays are well focused, with any discussion of extraneous t opics kept to a minimum.


Extraneous and strange both come from the same Latin word, extraneus, which  basically meant "external" or "coming from out side." But unlike strange, extraneous is a slight ly formal word, often used by scientist s  and  social scientist s. Researchers  always  try to eliminate extraneous fact ors (or "extraneous variables") from their st udies. A researcher conducting a psychological test , for example, would try to make sure that the people were tested under the same conditions, and were properly divided according to gender, age, health, and so on.
 

 
PHOT comes from the Greek word for "light ." Photography uses light to create an image on film or paper, and a photocopy is an image made by using lightand tiny electrically charged ink particles.
 
phot oelectric
    Involving an electrical effect  produced by the action of light or other radiation.


E.g.
 They wanted to avoid the kind of smoke detect or that uses radioactive materials, so they've installed the phot oelectric kind instead.


Th e photoelectric effect occurs when light (or similar radiation  such  as  X-rays) falls  on  a material such as a metal plate  and  causes  it to emit  electrons. The  discovery  of  the phot oelectric effect led to important new theories about mat ter (and to a Nobel Prize for Albert Einstein). Photoelectric cells, or photocells, are used in burglar-alarm light detect ors and garage-door openers (both employ a beam of light thatis broken when something moves across it ), and also to play soundtracks on movie film (where a light beam shines through the soundtrack encoded on the film and is "read" by the phot ocells).
 
phot ovoltaic
Involving the direct generation of electricity when sunlight or other radiantenergy falls on the boundary bet ween dissimilar substances (such as two different semiconduct ors).


E.g.
 Phot ovoltaic technology is being applied to thin film that can produce as much energy as solar cells while using far less semiconducting material.


The -voltaic part of photovoltaic comes from the name of Alessandro Volta, invent or of the electric bat tery. Thus, unlike phot oelectric cells, which use electricity for certain small tasks, phot ovoltaic (or PV) cells actually  produce  electricity.  Solar  cells,  the  standard  type  of phot ovoltaic cells (often called simply photocells), operate withoutchemicals and with no moving part s to create energy direct ly from sunlight . Much research is now being done on creating an alternative technology-solar film, which could be st uck onto almostany surface, or possibly even sprayed on.
 
phot on                    A tiny particle or bundle of radiantenergy.


E.g.
 The idea that light consist s of phot ons is difficult until you begin to think of a ray of lightas being caused by a stream of tiny particles.


It was Albert Einstein who first theorized that the energy in a light beam exist s in small bit s or particles, and scientist s t oday know that light sometimes behaves like a wave (somewhat like sound or water) and sometimes like a stream of particles. The energies of phot ons range from high-energy gamma rays and X-rays down to low-energy infrared and radio waves, though all travel at the same speed. The amazing power of lasers is the result of a concentration of phot ons thathave been made to travel t ogether in order to hit their targetat the same time.
 
phot osynthesis
   The process by which green plant s use light to produce organic mat ter from carbon dioxide and water.


E.g.
 Sagebrush survives in harsh climates because it 's capable of carrying on phot osynthesis at very low temperatures.


The Greek root s of photosynthesis combine to produce the basic meaning "to put t ogether with the help of light ." Phot osynthesis is what first produced oxygen in the at mosphere billions of years ago, and it 's still what keeps it there. Sunlight split s the water molecules (made of hydrogen and oxygen) held in a plant 's leaves and releases the oxygen in them into the air. The left over hydrogen combines with carbon dioxide to produce carbohydrates, which the plant uses as food-as do any animals or humans who mighteat the plant .
 
LUC comes from the Latin noun lux, "light ," and the verb lucere, "to shine or glit ter." In ancientrome, Lucifer, meaning "Light -bearer," was the name given to the morning star, but the name was eventually transferred by Christians to Satan. This tradition, which dates back to the period before Christ , said that Lucifer had once been among the angels buthad wanted to be the great lightin the sky, and for his pride had been cast out of heaven and thus became the opponent of everything good.
 
lucid                   (1) Very clear and easy to understand. (2) Able to think clearly.


E.g.
 On his last visithe had noticed thathis elderly mother hadn't seemed completely lucid.


Mental lucidity is easy to take for granted when we're young, though alcohol, drugs, and psychological instability can confuse the mind atany age. We all hope to live to 100 with our mental abilities intact , which is entirely possible; avoiding the condition called dementia (which includes the well-known Alzheimer's disease) often involves a combination of decent genes, physical and mental activity, and a good diet . Writing lucidly, on the other hand, can take a lot of work atany age; you've probably had the experience of trying to read a set of instructions and wondering if the writer even grew up speaking English.
 
elucidate
 To clarify by explaining; explain.


E.g.
 A good doct or should always be willing to elucidate any medical jargon he or she uses.


The  basic  meaning  of elucidate  is  "to  shed  light  on."  So  when  you  elucidate, you  make transparent or clear something thathad been murky or confusing. Elucidation of a complex new health-care policy may be a challenge. Elucidation of the terms of use for a credit card may be the last thing it s provider want s to do. The physicist Carl Sagan had  a  gift  for elucidating astronomical science to a large audience, his lucid explanations making clear how stars are born and die and how the universe may have begun.
 
lucubration
       (1) Hard and difficult  st udy. (2) The product  of such st udy.


E.g.
 Our professor admit ted thathe wasn't looking forward to reading through any more of our lucubrations on novels that no one enjoyed.


Lucubration came to mean "hard st udy" because it originally meant st udy done by lamplight , and in a world withoutelectric light s, such st udy was likely to be the kind of hard work that would only a dedicated st udent like Abe Lincoln would make a habit of. The word has a literary feel to it , and it 's often used with a t ouch of sarcasm.
 
translucent                           Part ly transparent ; allowing light to pass through without permit ting object s beyond to be seen clearly.


E.g.
 Architect s t oday often use industrial glass bricks in their home designs, because translucent walls admit daylight while guarding privacy.


With  it s  prefix trans-,  meaning  "through," translucent  describes  material  that  light  shines through without making anything on the other side clearly visible, unlike a transparent material. Frosted glass, often used in bathroom windows, is translucent , as is stained glass. Red wine in a crystal goblet , when held before a candle in a dark corner of a quietrestaurant , usually proves to be translucentas well.
 

 
MOR/MORT comes from Latin words meaning "to die" and "death." A mortuary is a place where dead bodies are kept until burial, and a postmortem examination is one conducted on a recent ly dead body. The Latin phrase "Memento mori" means "Remember thatyou must die"; so a memento mori is the name we give to a reminder of death; the skulls you can find carved on gravest ones in old cemeteries are examples.
 
mortality
   (1) The quality or state of being alive and therefore certain to die.
(2) The number of deaths that occur in a particular time or place.


E.g.
 Mortality rates were highestamong those who those who lived closest to the plant .


Young people tend to assume they will never die; buta person's sense of his or her mortality generally increases year by year, and often increases great ly after a serious accident or illness. Still, many people refuse to change behaviors that would improve their chances of living into old age. Mortality rates are calculated by governmentagencies, insurance companies, and medical researchers. Infant mortality rates (the rate at which infant s die in childbirth) provide a good indicat or of a country's overall health; in recentyears, the rates in countries like Iceland, Singapore, and Japan have been much bet ter than in the U.S.
 
moribund                  (1) In the process of dying or approaching death. (2) Inactive or becoming out moded.


E.g.
 Church at tendance in Britain has fallen in recentyears, but no one would say the Anglican church is moribund.


Moribund is still sometimes used in it s original literal sense of "approaching death," butit 's much more often used to describe things. When the economy goes bad, we hear about moribund mills and fact ories and t owns; the economy it self may even be called moribund. Critics may speak of the moribund state of poetry, or lament the moribund record or newspaper industry.
 
amortize                 To  pay  off  (something  such  as  a  mort gage)  by  making  small payment s over a period of time.


E.g.
 For tax purposes, they chose to amortize most of the business's start -up cost s over a three- year period.


Amortize is most common as a legal term, and many of us first come across it when we take outa mort gage or starta business. Financial officers and tax lawyers can choose how to legally amortize various types of business expenses, some of which may seem much bet ter than others. In mort gage amortization, much of what  you pay month by month is actually interest on the mort gage debt , especially at the beginning. So what does amortizing have to do with deathE.g.
 Basically, to amortize a debt means to "kill" it slowly over time.
 
mortify                    (1) To subdue or deaden (the body) especially by self-discipline or self- inflicted pain. (2) To embarrass great ly.


E.g.
 Our 14-year-old is mortified whenever he sees us dancing, especially if any of his school friends are around.


Mortify once actually meant "put to death," but no longer. It s "deaden" sense is most familiar to us in the phrase "mortifying the flesh," which refers to a cust om once followed by devout Christians, who would starve themselves, deprive themselves of every comfort , and even whip themselves in order to subdue their bodily desires and punish themselves for their sins. But the most common use of mortify t oday is the "humiliate" sense; it s connection with death is still apparent when we speak of "dying of embarrassment ."
 
TROPH comes from the Greek trophe, meaning "nourishment ." This particular troph- root doesn't show up in many everyday English words (the troph- in words like trophy, apostrophe, and catastrophe has a different meaning), butinstead tends to appear in scientific terms.
 
atrophy                 (1) Gradual loss of muscle or flesh, usually because of disease or lack of use. (2) A decline or degeneration.


E.g.
 After a month in a hospital bed, my father required a round of physical therapy to deal with his muscular atrophy.


From it s literal Greek root s, atrophy would mean basically "lack of nourishment ." Although the English word doesn't usually imply any lack of food, italways refers to a wasting away. Those who have been bedridden for a period of time will notice that their muscles have atrophied. And muscular atrophy is a frequentresult of such diseases as cancer and AIDS. We also use atrophy in a much more general sense. After being out of work a few years, you may find your work skills have atrophied; someone who's been living an isolated life may discover the same thing abouthis or her social skills; and a democracy can atrophy when it s citizens cease to pay at tention to how they're being governed.
 
hypertrophy                    (1)  Excessive   development   of   an   organ   or  part .  (2) Exaggerated growth or complexity.


E.g.
 Opponent s claimed that the Defense Depart ment , after years of being given t oo much money by the Congress, was now suffering from hypertrophy.


When the prefix hyper-, "above, beyond" (see HYPER), is joined to -trophy, we get the opposite of atrophy. An organ or part becomes hypertrophic when it grows so extremely thatit s function is affected. Muscle hypertrophy is common in men who do strength training, and is often harmless; butextreme muscle hypertrophy generally involves taking steroids, which can do great damage to the body. Hypertrophy of the heart sounds as if it might  be healthy, butinstead it 's usually a bad sign. As the example sentence shows, hypertrophy, like atrophy, can be used in nonmedical ways as well.
 
dystrophy              Any  of  several  disorders  involving  the  nerves  and  muscles, especially muscular dystrophy.


E.g.
 The most common of the muscular dystrophies affect s only males, who rarely live to the age of 40.


Since the prefix dys- means "bad" or "difficult " (see DYS), dystrophy is always a negative term. Originally it meant "a condition caused by improper nutrition," but t oday the term is instead used for a variety of other conditions, particularly conditions that noticeably affect the muscles. Of the many types of muscular dystrophy, the best known is Duchenne's, a terrible disease that strikes about one in 3,300 males and produces severe wasting of the muscles. However, the muscular dystrophies generally affect many other organs and systems as well. And the other dystrophies, which tend to involve the eyes or hands, don't much resemble the muscular dystrophies.
 
eutrophication
      The process by which a body of water becomes enriched in dissolved nutrient s.


E.g.
 Local naturalist s are get ting  worried  about  the  increasing  eutrophication  they've  been noticing in the lake.


Eutrophication, which comes from the Greek eutrophos, "well-nourished" (see EU), has become a major environmental problem. Nitrates and phosphates, especially from lawn fertilizers, run off the land into rivers and lakes, promoting the growth of algae and other plant life, which take oxygen from the water, causing the death of fish and mollusks. Cow manure, agricultural fertilizer, detergent s, and human waste are often to blame as well. In the 1960s and '70s, the eutrophication of Lake Erie advanced so extremely thatit became known as the "dead lake." And many areas of the oceans worldwide-some more than 20,000 square miles in extent - have become "dead zones," where almost no life of any kind exist s.
 

 
Words from Mythology and History

aeolian  harp
 A  box-shaped  instrument  with  strings  that  produce musical sounds when the wind blows on them.


E.g.
 Poet s have long been fascinated by the aeolian harp, the only instrument that produces music withouta human performer.


According to the ancient Greeks, Aeolus was the king or guardian of the winds. He lived in a cave with his many, many sons and daughters, and sent forth whatever wind Zeus asked for. When Odysseus st opped there on his way home from Troy, he received a bag of winds to fill his sails. But while he was asleep, his men, thinking it contained treasure, opened the bag and released the raging winds, which blew their ships all the way back to their starting point . An aeolian harp produces enchanting harmonies when the wind passes over it . According to Homer, it was the god Hermes who invented the harp, by having the wind blow over the dried sinews at tached to the shell of a dead t ort oise.
 
cynosure
 (1) A guide. (2) A center of at tention.


E.g.
 Near the club's dance floor, a young rock star was hanging out , the cynosure of a small crowd of admirers.


In Greek kynosoura means "dog's tail," and in Latin Cynosura came to mean the constellation Ursa Minor (Lit t le Bear)-what we usually call the Lit t le Dipper. The first star on the dog's or bear's "tail," or the dipper's "handle," is Polaris, the North Star, long used as a guide for seamen or travelers lost on a clear night , since, unlike the other stars, italways remains in the same position in the northern sky, while the other constellations (and even the rest of it s own constellation) slowly revolve around it . Since Cynosura also came to mean the star it self, the English cynosure now may mean both "guide" and "center of at tention."
 
laconic                        Using extremely few words.


E.g.
 Action-film script s usually seem to call for laconic leading men who avoid conversation but get the job done.


Ancient Sparta was located in the region of Greece known as Laconia, and the Greek word lakonikos could mean both "Laconian" and "Spartan." The disciplined and militaristic Spartans, the finest warriors of their time, were known for put ting up with extreme conditions without complaint . So English writers who knew their ancienthist ory came to use laconic to describe the habit of saying few words. Today we can refer not only to a laconic person butalso to laconic wit , a laconic answer, or a laconic phrase-such as "Men of few words require few laws," ut tered by a Spartan king.
 
mnemonic                          Having to do with the memory; assisting the memory.


E.g.
 Sales-training courses recommend various mnemonic devices as a way of remembering peoples' names.


The Greek word for memory is mnemosyne, and Mnemosyne was the goddess of memory and the mother of the Muses. So something thathelps the memory is a mnemonic aid, or simply a mnemonic. Such traditional mnemonic devices as "Every Good Boy Does Fine" (for the notes on the lines of a musical staff with a treble clef) or the "Thirty days hath September" rhyme help to recall simple rules or complicated series that might otherwise slip away. (For extra credit , guess what "King Henry Died Drinking Chocolate Milk" or "King Philip Could Only Find Green Socks" stands for.) Notice that the first m isn't pronounced, unlike in other -mne- words such as amnesia and amnesty.
 
plat onic                    (1) Relating to the philosopher Plato or his teachings. (2) Involving a close relationship from which romance and sex are absent .


E.g.
 The male and female leads in sit coms often keep their relationship plat onic for the first few seasons, butromance almostalways wins outin the end.


The philosopher Plato presented his theories in a series of dramatic conversations bet ween Socrates and other people, now called the "Plat onic dialogues." Among many other important concept s, he taught thateverything here on earth is a pale imitation-like a shadow-of it s ideal form, and this ideal form is now often called the "plat onic form." But platonic is probably usually seen in the phrase "plat onic love." Because Socrates (through Plat o) teaches that the philosophical person should turn his passion for a lover into appreciation of beauty and love of a higher power and of the universe, close but nonsexual friendship bet ween two people who might be thought to be romantically at tracted is t oday known as plat onic love or friendship.
 
sapphic                  (1) Lesbian. (2) Relating to a poetic verse pat tern associated with Sappho.


E.g.
 The Roman poet s Cat ullus and Horace composed wonderful love poems in sapphic verse.


The poet Sappho wrote poems of self-reflection butalso of passion, some of it directed to the women at tending the school she conducted on the Greek island of Lesbos around 600 B.C. Even though most of the poems survive only as fragment s, they have been great ly admired for many centuries. They were writ ten in an original rhythmical pat tern, which has become known as sapphic verse. Later admirers, such as the Roman poet s Cat ullus and Horace, honored her by adopting the sapphic meter for their own poetry. Because of Sappho, the island of Lesbos also gave it s name to lesbianism, which writers often used to call sapphic love.
 
Socratic                        Having to do with the philosopher Socrates or with his teaching method, in which he systematically questioned the st udentin conversation in order to draw forth truths.


E.g.
 She challenges her st udent s by using the Socratic method, requiring them to think and respond constant ly in every class.


Socrates lived and taughtin Athens in the 5th century B.C., but left no writings behind, so all we know of him comes through the works of his disciple Plat o, almostall of which claim to be account s of Socrates' conversations with others. Today Socrates is bestremembered for his method of teaching by asking increasingly difficult questions, the so-called Socratic method. This generally involves the use of Socratic induction, a way of gradually  arriving  at generalizations through a process of questions and answers, and Socratic irony, in which the teacher pretends ignorance while questioning his st udent s skillfully to make them aware of their errors in understanding.
 
solecism
     (1) A grammatical mistake in speaking or writing. (2) A blunder in etiquet te or proper behavior.


E.g.
 The poor boy commit ted his first solecism immediately on entering by tracking mud over the Persian rug in the dining room.


In ancientasia Minor (now Turkey), there was a city called Soloi where the inhabitant s spoke Greek that was full of grammatical errors. So errors in grammar, and later also small errors in formal social behavior, came to be known (at least by intellectuals) as solecisms. The British magazine The Economist publishes a list of solecisms to be avoided in it s prose, including the use of "try and" when you mean "try t o," "hone in on" when you mean "home in on," and so forth. Social solecisms, such as mentioning how inferior the wine is to someone who turns out to be the hostess's sister, are more commonly called by a French name, faux pas.

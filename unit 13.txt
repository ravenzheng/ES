CORD, from the Latin word for "heart ," turns up in several common English words. So does it s Greek relative card-, which is familiar to us in words such as cardiac, "relating to the heart ."
 
accord                    (1) To grant . (2) To be in harmony; agree.


E.g.
 What she t old police  under  questioning  didn't  accord  with  the  account s  of  the  other wit nesses.


A new federal law may accord with-or be in accordance with-the guidelines thata company has already established. The rowdy behavior of the hero Beowulf accords with Norse ideals of the early Middle Ages; but such behavior wouldn'thave been in accordance with the ideals of a later young lord from the same general region, Shakespeare's Prince Hamlet . Accord is also a noun, meaning "agreement ." Thus, we often hear of two countries signing a peace accord; and we also frequent ly hear of two things or people being "in accord with" each other.
 
concord                           (1) A state of agreement : harmony. (2) A formal agreement .


E.g.
 In 1801 Napoleon signed a concord with the pope reestablishing the Catholic Church in France.


The root s of concord  suggest the meaning  "heart s t ogether." At the  very out set of the American Revolution, the t own of Concord, Massachuset t s, was the site of a famous bat t le- obviously notexact ly in keeping with it s name. It shares that name with the capital of New Hampshire and a few other t owns and cities, and Concordia, the original Latin word for "concord," is the name of several Lutheran universities. Today concord is a rather formal term, probably most often used to mean a specific agreement ; thus, two countries may sign a concord on mat ters thathave led to trouble in the past .
 
cordial                   Warm, friendly, gracious.


E.g.
 After the meeting, the presidentextended a cordial invitation to everyone for coffee ather own house.


Anything thatis cordial comes from the heart . Cordial greetings to friends on the street , or cordial relations bet ween two countries, are warm without being passionate. Cordial is also a noun, which originally meantany stimulating medicine or drink that was thought to be good for the heart . Today a cordial is a liqueur, a sweetened alcoholic drink with interesting flavoring. Cordials such as cr¨¨me de menthe, Drambuie, or Benedictine are alcoholic enough to warm the spirit s and the heart .
 
discordant
    Being at odds, conflicting, notin harmony.


E.g.
 The first discordant note at dinner was struck by my cousin, when he claimed the president was only interested in taking away our guns.


Discord, a word more common in earlier centuries than t oday, means basically "conflict ," so discordant often means "conflicting." The opinions of Supreme Court  justices are frequent ly discordant ; justices who disagree with the Court 's decision usually write a dissenting opinion. Discordantis often used with a somewhat musical meaning, suggesting thata single wrong note or harmony has been heard in the middle of a performance-even though musical words such as chord actually come from a different Latin word, meaning "cord" or "string" (a reference to the strings of ancientinstrument s such as the lyre).
 
CULP comes from the Latin word for "guilt ." It s best -known appearance in English is probably in culprit, meaning someone who is guilty of a crime.
 
culpable                           Deserving to be condemned or blamed.


E.g.
 The company was found guilty of culpable negligence in allowing the chemical waste to leak into the groundwater.


Culpable normally means simply "guilty." To a lawyer, "culpable negligence" is carelessness so serious thatit becomes a crime-for instance, building a swimming pool in your suburban yard with no fence around it , so thata neighbor's child could fall in and drown. But degrees of culpability are importantin the law; someone who intended to do harm always faces a more serious challenge in court than someone who was merely careless.
 
exculpate
   To clear from accusations of fault or guilt .


E.g.
 The girls aren't proud of what they did that night , but they've been exculpated by wit nesses and won't be facing criminal charges.


Exculpate get s it s meaning from the prefix ex-, which here means "out of" or "away from." A suspected murderer may be exculpated by the confession of another person. And exculpatory evidence is the kind that defense lawyers are always looking for.
 
inculpate            To  accuse  or  incriminate; to show  evidence  of  someone's involvementin a fault or crime.


E.g.
 It was his own father who finally inculpated him, though withoutintending t o.


Inculpate is the opposite of exculpate, justas inculpatory evidence is the opposite of exculpatory evidence. By inculpating someone else, an accused person may manage to exculpate himself. Through plea bargaining, the prosecution can often encourage a defendant to inculpate his friends in return for a lighter sentence.
 
mea culpa
      An admission of personal fault or error.


E.g.
 The principal said his mea culpa at the school board meeting, but notall the parent s were satisfied.


Mea culpa, Latin for "through my fault ," comes from the prayer in the Catholic mass in which, back when Latin was still the language of the mass, one would confess to having sinned "mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa" ("through my fault , through my fault , through my most grievous fault "). When we say "Mea culpa" t oday, it means "I apologize" or "It was my fault ." But mea culpa is also common as a noun. So, for instance, a book may be a long mea culpa for the author's past treat ment of women, or an oil company may issue a mea culpa after a tanker runs aground.
 

 
DICT comes from dicere, the Latin word meaning "to speak." So a dictionary is a treasury of words for speaking. And a contradiction (with it s prefix contra-, "against ") speaks against or denies something.
 
diction                  (1) Choice of words, especially with regard to correct ness, clearness, or effectiveness. (2) Clarity of speech.


E.g.
 Our CEO is determined to appear in some TV ads, buthe first needs to work on his diction with a vocal coach.


When your English teacher complains about some of the words you chose to use in an essay, she's talking aboutyour diction. She may also use the term when commenting on the word choices made by a poet , and why a particular word was the best one possible in a particular line. (Compare syntax.) But the second meaning of diction is justas common, and your English teacher might use that one on you as well, especially when she's asked you to read something aloud and you mumble your way through it .
 
edict      (1) An official announcement  that  has the force of a law. (2) An order or command.


E.g.
 In 1989 an edict by the leader of Iran pronouncing a death sentence on a British novelist st unned the world.


Edict s are few and far bet ween in a democracy, since very few important laws can be made by a president or prime minister acting alone. But when a crisis arose in the Roman Republic, the senate would appointa dictator, who would have the power to rule by edict . The idea was that the dictat or could make decisions quickly, issuing his edict s faster than the senate could act . When the crisis was over, the edict s were canceled and the dictat or usually retired from public life. Things are different t oday: dictat ors almostalways install themselves in power, and they never give it up.
 
jurisdiction
     (1) The power or right to control or exercise authority. (2) The territ ory where power may be exercised.


E.g.
 Unluckily for the defendant s, the case fell within the jurisdiction of the federal courtrather than the more t olerant state court .


Questions of jurisdiction are generally technical legal mat ters. The mostimportant  ones include which court will hear a given case and which law-enforcementagency can getinvolved. Butalthough they may seem like mere technicalities, jurisdictional mat ters sometimes turn out to be all-importantin the final out come. Jurisdiction may depend on where you are (for example, in which state), on who you are (if you're a juvenile, for example, you may only be tried in juvenile court ), and on what the subjectis (for example, cases involving the estate left by someone who has died are dealt with in probate court ).
 
dict um                      A formal and authoritative statement .


E.g.
 Ithas long been a dict um of American foreign policy that the government doesn't negotiate with kidnappers and terrorist s.


The word dictum is frequent ly used in philosophy, butalso in economics, political science, and other fields. Almostany condensed piece of wisdom-"The perfectis the enemy of the good," "Buy low, sell high," "All politics is local," et c.-can be called a dict um. In the law, judges may often add to a writ ten opinion an obiter dictum, or "statement made in passing"-a strong statement thatisn't direct ly relevant to the case being decided. If they're well thought outand eloquent , obiter dicta (notice the plural form) may be referred to by later judges and lawyers for years afterward.
 
GNI/GNO comes from a Greek and Latin verb meaning "to know," and can be found at the root of know it self. Among other words built from this root , you may recognize ("know again") some and be ignorant of ("not know") others. But only an ignoramus would know absolutely none of them.
 
cognitive               (1) Having to do with the process of knowing, including awareness, judgment , and understanding. (2) Based on factual knowledge thathas been or can be gained by experience.


E.g.
 A child isn'ta computer; a third-grader's cognitive abilities are highly dependent on his or her upbringing and happiness.


Cognitive skills and knowledge involve the ability to acquire factual information, often the kind of knowledge that can easily be tested. So cognition should be distinguished from social, emotional, and creative developmentand ability. Cognitive science is a growing field of st udy that deals with human perception, thinking, and learning.
 
agnostic                A person who believes that whether God exist s is not known and probably cannot be known.


E.g.
 Both of them were always agnostics, butafter they had children they started at tending church again.


The words agnostic and agnosticism were coined around 1870 by the great English biologist T.
H. Huxley, who had just spenta decade defending the works of Charles Darwin against the at tacks of the church. Scientist s often puta high value on evidence when arguing aboutreligion, and many agnostic thinkers believe thathuman minds simply aren'tequipped to grasp the nature of God. Butagnostics differ from atheists, who actually claim that no God exist s and may even think they can prove it . You may have seen the similar word gnostic, the name for followers of certain religious sect s from around the time of Christ that sought spiritual knowledge and rejected the material world. An increasing interestin gnosticism t oday can be seen in the popular novels of Philip Pullman, Dan Brown, and Neil Gaiman.
 
incognit o
In disguise, or with one's identity concealed.


E.g.
 Years after her reign as a t op Hollywood star, she was discovered working incognito as a bartender in Manhat tan while living in cheap hotels.


In a famous myth, Zeus and Hermes visita village incognito to test the villagers. The seemingly poor travelers are turned away from every household except that of Baucis and Philemon. This elderly couple, though very poor themselves, provide the disguised gods with a feast . When the gods finally reveal themselves, they reward the couple generously for their hospitality, but destroy the rest of the village.
 
prognosis
    (1) The chance of recovery from a given disease or condition. (2) A forecast or prophecy.


E.g.
 The prognosis for a patient with chicken pox is usually excellent ; the prognosis for someone with liver cancer is terrible.


With it s prefix pro-, meaning "before," prognosis means basically "knowledge beforehand" of how a situation is likely to turn out . Prognosis was originally a strict ly medical term, butit soon broadened to include predictions made by expert s of all kinds. Thus, for example, economist s are constant ly offering prognoses (notice the irregular plural form) about where the economy is going, and climate scientist s regularly prognosticate abouthow quickly the earth's at mosphere is warming.
 

 
GRAPH comes from the Greek verb graphein, "to write." Thus, a biography is a writ ten account of someone's life (see BIO), a discography is a writ ten list of recordings on disc (records or CDs), and a filmography is a list of motion pictures. But lot s of uses of -graph and - graphy don't mean literally "writing" (as in autograph or paragraph), butinstead something more like "recording," as in photography, seismograph, or graph it self.
 
calligraphy
 The art of producing beautiful handwriting.


E.g.
 Calligraphy can be seen t oday in eventinvitations, logo designs, and st one inscriptions.


Kalli- is a Greek root meaning "beautiful," and "beautiful" in the case of calligraphy means artistic, stylized, and elegant . Calligraphy has existed in many cultures, including Indian, Persian, and Islamic cultures; Arabic put s a particularly high value on beautiful script , and in Eastasia calligraphy has long been considered a major art . Calligraphers in the West use pens with wide nibs, with which they produce strokes of widely differing width within a single let ter.
 
hagiography
 (1) Biography of saint s. (2) Biography that  idealizes or idolizes.


E.g.
 According to the new biography, which should really be called a hagiography, the former prime minister doesn't seem to have done anything small-minded or improper in his entire life.


For those able to read, reading st ories of the lives of the saint s was a popular pastime for centuries, and books collecting short saint s' biographies were best sellers. These often included terrifically colorful st ories (about slaying dragons, magically traveling through space, et c.) that were perhaps a bit t oo good to be strict ly true, and after finding God not one of them ever did a single thing that wasn't saint ly-and some of them may nothave actually existed. Still t oday, hagiographic account s of the lives of politicians and pop-culture stars are being writ ten, though there now seems to be a bigger audience for biographies that seek out the not -so-wholesome secret s of the person's life, sometimes even making up a few of them.
 
choreography                        (1) The art of composing and arranging dances and of representing them in symbolic notation. (2) The movement s by dancers in a performance.


E.g.
 The reviews praised the show for it s eye-catching choreography, calling it the bestelement of the whole musical.


In ancient Greece, a choreia was a circular dance accompanied by a singing chorus. But the actual notating of dances by means of symbols didn't begin until the 17th or 18th century, when ballet developed into a complex art form in France. The choreographer of a major ballet , which mightrun to an hour or more, will always record his or her work in notation, though choreographing a five-minute segment for a TV talent show usually doesn'trequire any record atall.
 
lithograph                           A picture made by printing from a flat surface (such as a smooth st one) prepared so that the ink will only stick to the design that will be printed.


E.g.
 To make a lithograph, the artist first draws an image, in reverse, on a fine-grained limest one or aluminum plate.


Lithos is Greek for "st one," and a st one surface has traditionally been involved in lithography, though a metal plate may take it s place t oday. The lithographic process was invented around 1796 and soon became the main method of printing books and newspapers. Artist s use lithography to produce print s (works intended to be sold in many copies), and art lithographs sometimes resemble older types of print s, including etchings, engravings, and woodcut s. Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Joan Mir¨®, and M. C. Escher are among the many artist s who have used lithography to produce important original works. Today lithographic printing account s for over 40% of all printing, packaging, and publishing.
 
ART comes from the Latin word for "skill." This reminds us that , until a few centuries ago, almost no one made a strong distinction bet ween skilled craft smanship and what we would now call "art ." And the word artit self could also mean simply "cleverness." The resultis that this rootappears in some words where we might notexpectit .
 
art ful                  (1) Skillful. (2) Wily, crafty, sly.


E.g.
 It was an art ful solution: each side was pleased with the agreement , butit was the lawyer himself who st ood to make the most money off of it .


A writer may produce an art ful piece of prose, one that 's clearly and elegant ly writ ten. The same writer mightalso make an art ful argument , one that cleverly leaves out certain details and plays up others so as to make a stronger case. In the firstinstance, the prose is well crafted; in the second, the argument mightinstead be called crafty. Buteven though both uses are correct , most of us still use artful somewhat different ly from artistic.
 
artifact            A usually simple object made by human workmanship, such as a t ool or ornament , thatrepresent s a culture or a stage in a culture's development .


E.g.
 Through the artifact s found by archaeologist s, we now know a considerable amountabouthow the early Anasazi people of the Southwest lived.


One of the things that make humans unique is their ability to make and use t ools, and ever since the firstrough st one axes began to appear about 700,000 years ago, human cultures have left behind artifact s from which we've tried to draw a picture of their everyday life. The root s of artifact mean basically "something made with skill"; thus, a mere st one that was used for pounding isn'tan artifact , since it wasn't shaped by humans for it s purpose-unlike a ram's horn that was polished and given a brass mouthpiece and was blown as part of a religious ritual.
 
artifice                        (1) Clever skill. (2) A clever trick.


E.g.
 By his cunning and artifice, Iago convinces Othello that Desdemona has been unfaithful.


Artifice can be a tricky word to use. It combines the same root s as artifact, so it 's sometimes seen in descriptions of craft smanship ("The artifice that wentinto this jewelry can still ast ound us," "The chef had used all his artifice to disguise the nature of the meat "). Butit can also be used for many situations that don'tinvolve physical materials ("They had got ten around the rules by a clever artifice," "The artifice of the plotis ingenious"). Like it s adjective, artificial, artifice isn't necessarily either positive nor negative. But both words can make us slight ly uncomfortable if we like to think of simplicity and naturalness as important values.
 
artisan                          A skilled worker or craft sperson.


E.g.
 At the fair, they saw examples of the best carving, pot tery, and jewelry by local artisans.


Artisans aren't the same as artists, butit can sometimes be hard to tell the difference. In the Middle Ages, artisans organized themselves into guilds. In every city each group of artisans- weavers, carpenters, shoemakers, and so on-had it s own guild, which set wages and prices, kept standards high, and protected it s members from out side competit ors. In America, however, mostartisans have always been fiercely independent . Today, when fact ories produce almostall of our goods, artisans usually make only fine object s for those who can afford them. And we now even include food among the artisan's craft s, so you can buy artisanal cheeses, breads, and chocolates-but probably notif you're watching your budget .
 

 
FORT  comes   from fortis,  Latin  for  "strong."  The  familiar  noun fort,  meaning  a  building strengthened against  possible at tacks, comes direct ly from it . And our verb comfortactually means "to give strength and hope t o."
 
fortify                      To strengthen.


E.g.
 Fortified by a good night 's sleep and a big breakfast , they set off for the final 20 miles of their journey.


Medieval cities were fortified againstat tack by high walls, and volunteers may fortify a levee againstan overflowing river by means of sandbags. Foods can be fortified by adding vitamins, but "fortified wines," such as sherry and port , have brandy (a "stronger" drink) rather than vitamins added to them. By adopting good exercise habit s, you can fortify your body againstillness. And fortifying needn'talways be physical. An author's reputation may be fortified by the success of his new book, or a prosecut or can fortify a case againsta suspect by finding more evidence.
 
fortification
      (1) The building of military defenses to protecta place againstat tack. (2) A structure built to protecta place.


E.g.
 The city's fortifications had withst ood powerful assault s by catapult s, bat tering rams, and tall siege t owers thatrolled up to release soldiers onto the t op of the walls.


In the Middle Ages, many European cities were entirely enclosed by sturdy walls, with walkways along the t op and t owers atintervals, designed to make an invasion impossible. A water-filled ditch, or moat , might  run alongside the wall for added defense. Such defenses turned the entire city into a fort, or fortress. Over the centuries, fortifications changed steadily with the development of new weaponry. In World War I, the German fortification of the French coastincluded antitank barriers, bunkers, minefields, and underwater obstacles, butit wasn'tenough to turn back the immense force of the Allied invasion on D-day.
 
forte
  Something that  a person does particularly well; one's strong point .


E.g.
 Her forte was statistics, and she was always ata disadvantage when the discussion turned to public policy.


In the Middle Ages, swords were often known to break in bat t le, so the strongest part of a sword's blade-the part bet ween the handle (or hilt ) and the middle of the blade-was given a name, the forte. Today a forte is usually a special strength. But no one can agree on how to pronounce it : all three pronunciations shown above are heard frequent ly. Part of the problem is confusion with the Italian musical term forte (always pronounced / f    r-t   /), meaning "loud."
 
fortit ude                         Mental strength thatallows one to face danger, pain, or hardship with courage.


E.g.
 He's just t oo nice, and we worry thathe won'thave the fortit ude to deal with the monsters in that office.


How many people know that the famous marble lions that guard the steps of the New York Public Library in Manhat tan are named Patience and Fortit udeE.g.
 In Latin, the quality of fortitudo combines physical strength, vigor, courage, and boldness, but the English fortitude usually means simply firmness and steadiness of will, or "backbone." The philosopher Plato long ago listed four essential human virt ues-prudence (i.e., good judgment ), justice (i.e., ability to be fair in balancing bet ween one's own  interest s  and  others'),  temperance  (i.e.,  moderation  or restraint ), and fortit ude, and in Christian tradition these became known as the four "cardinal virt ues."
 
CIS comes from the Latin verb meaning "to cut , cut down, or slay." An incisor is one of the big front biting teeth; beavers and woodchucks have especially large ones. A decision "cut s off" previous discussion and uncertainty.
 
concise                      Brief and condensed, especially in expression or statement .


E.g.
 Professor Childs's exam asked for a concise, one-page summary of the causes of the American Revolution.


Many st udent s think thatadding unnecessary sentences with long words will make their writing more impressive. Butin factalmostevery reader values concision, since concise writing is usually easier to read, bet ter thought out , and bet ter organized-thatis, simply bet ter writing. Words such as short don'thave the full meaning of concise, which usually means not just "brief" but "packed with information."
 
excise                    To cut out , especially surgically.


E.g.
 The ancient Minoans from the island of Crete apparent ly excised the heart s of their human sacrifices.


Excise takes part of it s meaning from the prefix ex-, "out ." A writer may excise long passages of a novel to reduce it to a reasonable length, or a film direct or may excise a scene that might give offense. A surgeon may excise a large cancerous t umor, or make a tiny excision to examine an  organ's tissue. Excise is also a noun, meaning a tax paid on something manufactured and sold in the U.S. Much of what consumers pay for  t obacco  or alcohol product s go to cover the excise taxes that the state and federal governmentcharge the manufacturers. Butit 's only accidental that this noun is spelled like the verb, since it comes from a completely different source.
 
incisive                      Impressively directand decisive.


E.g.
 A few incisive questions were all that was needed to expose the weakness  in  the prosecut or's case.


From it s root s, incise means basically "to cutint o." So justas a doct or uses a scalpel to make an incision in the skin, an incisive remark cut s into the mat ter athand. A good analyst makes incisive comment s abouta news st ory, cut ting through the unimportant details, and a good critic incisively identifies a book's strengths and weaknesses.
 
precision
 Exact ness and accuracy.


E.g.
 By junior year she was speaking with greater precision, searching for exact words in place of the crude, awkward language of her friends.


Many of us often use precision and accuracy as synonyms, but not scientist s and engineers. For them, accuracy describes a particular measurement -thatis, how close itis to the truth. But precision describes a measurement system-thatis, how good itis at giving the same resultevery time it measures the same thing. This may be why even nonscientist s now often speak of "precision instrument s" for measuring, "precision landings" made by airplanes, "precision drilling" for natural gas, and so on.
 

 
Animal Words

apiary                           A place where bees are kept for their honey.


E.g.
 Apple orchards are excellent sites for apiaries, since the bees keep the  apple  trees productive by pollinating them.


Beekeeping, or apiculture, is the care of honeybees thatensures that they produce more honey than they can use. An apiary usually consist s of many separate beehives. The social life of a hive is strange and marvelous. The queen bee, who will become the mother of an entire colony, is actually created by being fed "royal jelly" while she is still only a larva. The tens of thousands of worker bees are underdeveloped females; only a handful of the bees are male, and they do no work atall. The workers defend the hive by kamikaze means, stinging any intruder and dying as they do so. There's more drama in a quiet -looking apiary than the casual observer might notice.
 
caper                    (1) A playful leap. (2) A prank or mischievous adventure.


E.g.
 For their caper in the girls' bathroom, all three seniors were suspended for a week.


Caper in Latin means "a male goat ." Anyone who has watched a young goat frolic in a field or clamber onto the roof of a car knows the kind of crazy fun the English word caper -which is also a verb-is referring t o. A capriole is a backward kick done in midair by a trained horse. Capricorn, meaning "horned goat ," is a constellation and one of the signs of the zodiac. And a capricious actis one that 's done with as lit t le thoughtas a frisky goat might give it .
 
equestrian
      Of or relating to horseback riding.


E.g.
 The circus's equestrian act s, in which bareback riders performed daring acrobatic feat s at op prancing horses, were her favorites.


Equestrian comes from equus, Latin for "horse." Old stat ues of military heroes, like the famous one of General Sherman on New York's Fifth Avenue, are frequent ly equestrian. In these sculptures the man always sit s nobly upright on a horse, but the horse's stance varies; depending on whether the rider was killed in bat t le or survived, was vict orious or defeated, the horse traditionally stands with four, three, or two hooves on the ground. Equestrian stat ues have been popular through the centuries, because until the 20th century almostevery officer in Europe and America was trained in equestrian skills and combat .
 
lupine                  Like a wolf; wolfish.


E.g.
 Doct ors reported that the boy showed lupine behavior such as snarling and biting, and walked with his knees bentin a kind of crouch.


Lupine comes from lupus, Latin for "wolf," and it s related adjective lupinus, "wolfish." Lupine groups  have  a  highly  organized   social   structure,  with   leaders   and   followers   clearly distinguished; dogs, since they're descended from wolves, often show these lupine pat terns when living in groups. St ories of children raised by wolves (the most famous being Romulus, the legendary founder of Rome) have generally been hard to prove, part ly because "wild" children lack human language abilities and can't describe their experiences. Lupine is also a noun, the name of a well-known garden flower, which was once thought to drain, or "wolf," the soil of it s nutrient s.
 
ovine                 Of, relating t o, or resembling sheep.


E.g.
 In her veterinary practice she specialized in ovine medicine, but often treated cows and pigs as well.


Sheep belong to the same family of mammals as goat s, antelope, bison, buffalo, and cows. The genus Ovis includes at least five species, including the domestic sheep. Some 12,000 years ago, in the area now known as Iraq, sheep became one of the firstanimals to be domesticated; only the dog is known to have been tamed earlier. At first , they were valued for their milk, skin, and meat (mut t on and lamb); not until about 1500 B.C. did the weaving of wool begin. Today a billion sheep are being farmed worldwide. The term ovine (which is a noun as well as an adjective) is most ly used in scientific and medical writing-which means you could impress your friends by dropping itinto a casual conversation.
 
ornithologist
     A person who st udies birds.


E.g.
 John James Audubon, the great painter of the birds of early America, was also a writing ornithologist of greatimportance.


The Greek root ornith- means "bird," so ornithology is the st udy of birds. Amateur ornithology, usually called birding or birdwatching, is an extraordinarily popular pastime in America, where over 40 million people pursue it . Roger Tory Peterson's many field guides have long been some of the amateur ornithologist 's most useful t ools. Amateurs often make essential contributions to serious ornithology, as in the annual Christ mas Bird Count , when tens of thousands of birders fan outacross North and South America to produce a kind of census of all the species in the New World.
 
serpentine
   Like a snake or serpentin shape or movement ; winding.


E.g.
 The Great Wall of China, the greatest construction of all time, wends it s serpentine way for some 4,000 miles across the Chinese landscape.


A snake moves by curving and winding along the ground. Roads through the Pyrenees, the mountains that separate Spain from France, tend to be serpentine, curving back and forth on themselves up and down the steep slopes.

NOM comes from the Latin word for "name." A nominee is a person "named"-or nominated- to run for or serve in office. A binomial ("two names") is the scientific name for a species: Felis catus for the house cat , for example. A polynomial, with "many names," is an algebra expression involving several terms: 2x2 + 9y - z3, for instance.
 
nominal                          (1) Existing in name or form only and notin reality. (2) So small as to be unimportant ; insignificant .


E.g.
 The act or himself was the nominal author, but 90 percent of the prose was the work of his ghost writer.


Something nominal exist s only in name. So the nominal ruler in a constit utional monarchy is the king or queen, but the real power is in the hands of the elected prime minister. In the United Kingdom, the British monarch is also the nominal head of the Church of England; and those baptized in the Church who aren'treally churchgoers might be called nominal Christians. A fee can be called nominal when it 's small in comparison to the value of whatit buys. So, for example, you might sell a friend a good piece of furniture for a nominal amount . And the charge for a doct or's visit might be a nominal $20, since most of the costis covered by an insurance plan.
 
nomenclature
         (1) A name or designation, or the act of naming. (2) A system of terms or symbols used in biology, where New Latin names are given to kinds and groups of animals and plant s.


E.g.
 Naming newly discovered plant s or animals requires close st udy of the system of nomenclature.


Various specialized fields have their own particular nomenclatures, or set s of terms. In particle physics, for instance, the elementary particles known as quarks, which are believed to come in pairs, have acquired such names as "up" and "down," "strange" and "charm," and "truth" and "beauty"-which is all most of us know about quarks and all we need to know. But nomenclature is used most often for the system of biological classification created by Linnaeus. In Linnaeus's system, each species has it s own t wo-word name, the first word being the name of it s genus. Thus, the genus Equus includes the horse (Equus caballus) and the mountain zebra (Equus zebra). But since broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage actually all belong to the  same  species (Brassica  oleracea),  they  each  need  a  third  name to distinguish themselves.
 
ignominious (1)  Marked  with  shame  or  disgrace; dishonorable. (2) Humiliating or degrading.


E.g.
 If At tila the Hun was truly murdered by his bride on their wedding night , it  was a mostignominious death for a warrior.


The Latin nomen could mean both "name" and "good reputation," and even t oday we can say that someone who has been disgraced has "losthis good name." With it s negative prefix ig-, ignominious indicates the "namelessness" that goes with shame or dishonor. A person who suffers an ignominious fate may die nameless and forgot ten. In the former Soviet Union, party leaders who fell out  of favor, even if  they avoided being imprisoned or executed, became nonpersons. Their names were removed from official records and hist ory books and they were treated as if they had never existed.
 
misnomer
    A wrong name, or the use of a wrong name.


E.g.
 Calling the native peoples of the western hemisphere "Indians" was one of the great misnomers in recorded hist ory.


Hist orians have long noted that the Holy Roman Empire in it s later years was neither holy, Roman, nor an empire. The Bat t le of Bunker Hill was actually fought on nearby Breed's Hill. And the famous Woodst ock Festival was actually held in the t own of Bethel. But misnomers aren't limited to hist ory. The Pennsylvania Dutch are actually of German ancestry. Koala bears aren't bears-they're marsupials. And in the world of food, the Rocky Mountain oyster, as diners have sometimes discovered t oo late, aren'treally oysters.
 
PATER/PATR comes from both the Greek and the Latin word for "father." So a patron, for example, is someone who assumes a fatherly role t oward an instit ution or project or individual, giving moral and financial support .
 
patrician                          A person of high birth or of good breeding and cultivation; an arist ocrat .


E.g.
 They passed themselves off as patricians, and no one looked t oo closely at where their money came from.


A patrician was originally a descendant of one of the original citizen families of ancientrome. Until about 350 B.C., only patricians could hold the office of senat or, consul, or pontifex (priest ). Later, the word was applied to members of the  nobility  created  by  the  Roman  emperor Constantine. As time went by, other nobles, such as those in medieval Italian republics and in German city-states, also  came to be known  as patricians. Today someone's appearance, manners, or tastes can be described as patrician, whether the person is actually of high birth or not . The actress Grace Kelly, an immigrant 's daughter, was admired for her patrician beauty even before she became Princess Grace of Monaco, with classic features worthy of ancientrome's finest sculpt ors.
 
patriarchy                           (1) A family, group, or government controlled by a man or a group of men. (2) A social system in which family members are related to each other through their fathers.


E.g.
 She spent the 1980s raging against the patriarchy, which she claimed had destroyed the lives of millions of women.


With it s root -arch, meaning "ruler, leader," a patriarch is a man who dominates something, even if it 's justa family. In Christianity, the term is used for a few leading figures who appear early in  the Old Testament , including Methuselah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; in the Eastern Orthodox church, a patriarch is usually the equivalent of a bishop. Out side of the field of anthropology, patriarchy didn't start to be used much until the 1970s, when the women's movement gained a huge following. Many feminist s have claimed thatall Western societies are patriarchal-thatis, that they systematically enable men to dominate women. But there's plenty of disagreementabouthow this is done, and the word isn't discussed as often as it used to be.
 
expatriate
      A person who has moved to a foreign land.


E.g.
 As he got to know his fellow expatriates in Morocco, he found himself wondering whathad led each of them to leave America.


Expatriate combines the prefix ex-, "out of" or "away from," with the Latin patria, "fatherland." A famous colony of expatriates was the group of writers and artist s who gathered in Paris bet ween the two world wars, including Ernesthemingway, F. Scot t Fit zgerald, and Gertrude Stein. Unlike an exile or an emigrant , an expatriate's residence abroad is usually voluntary and extended but not permanent , and expatriates-often called expats-generally keep their original   national   identity   and   eventually   end   their   self-imposed   exiles   by repatriating themselves.
 
paternalistic
    Tending to supply the needs of or regulate the activities of those under one's control.


E.g.
 Some still accuse the university of being t oo paternalistic in regulating st udent living arrangement s.


A good father shows paternal concern abouthis children, justas a good mother often act s outo f maternal feeling. But paternalistic has a negative sound nowadays, since paternalistic people or instit utions seek-often with decentintentions-to control many aspect s of the lives of those under their control. In the 19th century, mill owners actually often provided cheap housing for the mill's employees. Today companies frequent ly have strictrules regarding personal appearance, or against marriages within the company. Colleges and universities used to practice a kind of paternalism, especially in trying to keep men and women out of each other's dorms, buta changing society has most ly putan end to that .
 

 
LEGA comes from the Latin legare, meaning "to appoint " or "to send as a deputy." The same rootactually shows up in such words as legal-but  how  the  law  connect s  with  sending deputies can getawfully complicated and probably isn't worth going int o.
 
legate                  An official representative, such as an ambassador.


E.g.
 All the important European powers sent legates of some kind to the peace conference.


Legate is a somewhat old-fashioned word, less used t oday than it was a century ago. More common is the synonym envoy. In the days before electronic communications, a legate often had particularly large responsibilities, since he couldn'tcheck with his government to be sure he was doing the right thing. The Vatican still sends papal legates to represent the pope's point of view in negotiations.
 
legacy               (1) Something left to a person in a will. (2) Something handed down by an ancest or or predecessor or received from the past .


E.g.
 The Stradivarius family of violin makers lefta priceless legacy of remarkable instrument s.


In it s basic meaning, a legacy is a gift of money or other personal property that 's granted by the terms of a will-often a substantial gift that needs to be properly managed. But the word is used much more broadly as well. So, for instance, much of Western civilization-law, philosophy, aesthetics- could be called the undying legacy of ancient Greece. And the right s and opport unities that women enjoy t oday are part ly the legacy of the early suffragist s and feminist s.
 
delegation                         A group  of  people  chosen to represent  the  interest s  or opinions of others.


E.g.
 Each American colony senta delegation to the Second Continental Congress, and in it s second year all 56 delegates approved Jefferson's Declaration of Independence.


The task of a delegation-each member of which can be called a delegate-is to representa larger group, often ata conference. Thus, a delegation of nondoct ors to a medical convention may want to make sure the right s and needs of patient s aren'tignored, justas a delegation of laypeople may at tend a religious conference to express the concerns of other laypeople.
 
relegate                    (1) To remove or assign to a less important place. (2) To refer or hand over for decision or for carrying out .


E.g.
 First -year st udent s were relegated to the back of the line so thatall the upper classes could eat first .


Originally relegate meant "to send into exile, banish." So when you relegate an old sofa to the basement , you're sending it to home-decorating Siberia. When confronted with a mat ter that no one really want s to face, a chief executive may relegate it to a commit tee "for further st udy," which may manage to ignore it for years. It may be annoying to read a newspaper article abouta pet projectand find thatyour own contributions have been relegated to a short sentence near the end.
 
GREG comes from the Latin grex, "herd" or "flock." Bees, starlings, cows-any creatures that like to live t ogether in flocks or herds-are called gregarious, and the same word is used for people who enjoy companionship and are happiest when they're in the middle of a rowdy herd.
 
aggregate                          A collection or sum of unit s or part s.


E.g.
 His lawyers realize that the aggregate of incriminating details is now pointing t oward a conviction.


An aggregate is often an example of something being greater than the sum of it s part s. For instance, even if no individual elementin a person's background would assure a criminal career, the aggregate of fact ors could make a life of crime seem unavoidable. Aggregate is often used in the phrase "in the aggregate," as in "Her achievement s were, in the aggregate, impressive enough to earn her a scholarship." Aggregate is also an adjective, meaning "t otal"; so, for instance, economist s often discuss aggregate demand for goods and services in the country's economy, just  as you yourself might  speak about  your father's aggregate income from his three jobs.
 
congregation
    (1) A gathering of people, especially for worship or religious instruction. (2) The membership of a church or temple.


E.g.
 That Sunday the congregation was especially large, and the minister delivered one of his best sermons.


The verb congregate may be used for spontaneous gatherings. A crowd quickly congregates at the scene of an accident , for example, justas cows, sheep, or horses tend to congregate during a st orm. And under military rule, citizens are often forbidden to congregate on street corners or anywhere else. Buta congregation is generally a group thathas gathered for a formal purpose, usually in church. The Congregational Church was originally the church of the Puritan set t lers, in which each congregation governed it s own church independent of any higher authority.
 
egregious                        Standing out , especially in a bad way; flagrant .


E.g.
 Many of the term papers contained egregious grammatical errors.


Since egregious begins with a short version of ex-, meaning "out of," the word should mean literally "out of the herd." So something egregious possesses some quality that set s itapart from others. Originally, that distinguishing quality was something good, but by the 16th century the word's meaning had taken a U-turn and the word was being applied to things that were outrageously bad. This has remained the most common sense. Thus, an egregious fool is one who manages to out do run-of-the-mill fools, and egregious rudeness set s a new standard for unpleasant salesclerks.
 
segregate                           (1) To separate from others or from the general mass; isolate. (2) To separate along racial lines.


E.g.
 Some schools are experimenting with gender segregation, claiming that both sexes learn bet ter in classrooms from which the other sex is absent .


The prefix se- means "apart ," so when you segregate something you setitapart from the herd. The word typically means separating something undesirable from the healthy majority. During the apple harvest , damaged fruitis segregated from the main crop and used for cider. In prisons, hardened criminals are segregated from youthful offenders. Lepers used to be segregated from the general population because they were thought to be highly infectious. The opposite of segregate is often integrate, and the two words were in the news almost daily for decades as African-Americans struggled to be admit ted into all-white schools and neighborhoods.
 

 
FLU comes from the Latin verb fluere, "to flow." So a flume is a narrow gorge with a stream flowing through it . A fluent speaker is one from whom words flow easily. Influence originally referred to an invisible fluid that was believed to flow from the stars and to affect the actions of humans. A mysterious out break of disease in 15th-century Italy led Italians to blame it on the stars' influenza-and the name st uck.
 
affluence                          An abundance of wealth.


E.g.
 The affluence of the city's northern suburbs is indicated by the huge houses there.


Affluence comes from the Latin verb affluere, "to flow abundant ly."  Thus,  someone  or something blessed with affluence has received an incoming flood of riches. Since the affluentresident s of suburbs often work in the central city but pay taxes back home, the wealth of some metropolitan areas tends to flow in one direction-out .
 
effluent                          Polluting waste material discharged into the environment .


E.g.
 The effluent from the mill had long ago turned this once-beautiful stream into a foul-smelling open-air sewer.


Effluent comes from the Latin verb effluere, "to flow out ." In an older meaning, an effluent was a stream flowing out of a river or lake. But nowadays effluentalmostalways means wastes that pour into our water and air. Liquid fact ory waste, smoke, and raw sewage can all be called effluent s. An effluent filter keeps treated waste flowing out of a septic tank from clogging up it s drainage pipes.
 
confluence                           (1) A coming or flowing t ogether at one point . (2) A place of meeting, especially of two streams.


E.g.
 The confluence of several large economic forces led to the "perfect st orm" that shook the world economy in 2008.


The joining of rivers-as atharpers Ferry, West Virginia, where the Shenandoah and Pot omac Rivers flow t ogether spectacularly-was the original meaning of confluence, and in it s later meanings we still hear a strong echo of the physical merging of waters. So t oday we can speak of a confluence of event s, a confluence of interest s, a confluence of cultures, and so on, from which something important often emerges.
 
mellifluous
     Flowing like honey; sweetened as if with honey.


E.g.
 His rich, mellifluous voice is familiar to us from count less voice-overs for commercials, station breaks, and documentaries.


With it s root mel-, meaning "honey," mellifluous means literally "flowing like honey." The word usually applies to sound; ithas often been used to describe voices such as Renee Fleming's or Barbra Streisand's, or pieces by composers such as Ravel and Debussy. The DJ on a radio station that plays soft music may have a voice so mellifluous thatitalmost put s the listener to sleep.
 
PREHEND/PREHENS comes from the Latin verb prehendere, "to seize." Most of the English words where itappears are closely related to the ones discussed below.
 
prehensile
   Adapted for grasping, especially by wrapping around.


E.g.
 The squid has eight short "arms" butalso two long prehensile tentacles that  it  uses for catching it s prey.


Howler monkeys are among the American monkeys with prehensile tails. Famous for their booming howls, howlers can wrap their tails around a nearby branch while using their prehensile feetand hands for picking lice from their fur or lobbing a coconutatan unwelcome t ourist . Our own hands are prehensile, of course. Our feetare not ; on the other hand, they're much bet ter for running than the prehensile feet of a monkey or ape.
 
apprehend
 (1) Arrest , seize. (2) Understand.


E.g.
 It was a few minutes before she managed to apprehend the meaning of what she had just seen.


To apprehend is to seize, either physically or mentally. So to apprehend a thief is to nab him. But to apprehend a confusing news st ory, or to apprehend a difficult conceptin physics, is to understand it -thatis, to "grasp" it mentally. If you're apprehensive about something that 's about to happen, it means you've grasped all the unpleasant possibilities and are waiting with anxiety or dread.
 
comprehend                          (1) To grasp the meaning of; understand. (2) To take in or include.


E.g.
 In the days following the dropping of the at omic bomb on Hiroshima, the public slowly began to comprehend the fact that the nuclear age had arrived.


To comprehend is to mentally grasp something's complete nature or meaning. Comprehend is thus often a bit stronger than understand: for example, you may understand the instructions in a handbook without completely comprehending their purpose. Comprehend's second meaning is much less common. Using that sense of the word, we could say that good manners comprehends (thatis, includes) more than simple table etiquet te, for example, or that true courage comprehends more than just physical showing off. And something comprehensive includes a great deal: so a comprehensive exam, for instance, includes all the material that was st udied in the course.
 
reprehensible
        Deserving stern criticism or blame.


E.g.
 Whether or nothe ever broke the law, his treat ment of his first wife was thoroughly reprehensible.


From it s prefix re-, meaning "back," reprehend would mean literally "to hold back, restrain"; buteven the Latin version of the verb had come to mean "to scold, blame"-in other words, to restrain bad behavior by expressing disapproval. Reprehensible is applied to both things and people-thatis, both the sin and the sinner. So a senat or might be scolded for reprehensible conduct , but mightalso be called a thoroughly reprehensible person. And most of us would call dogfighting morally reprehensible, and would use the same word to describe those who put the dogs up to it .
 

 
TEMPER comes from the Latin verb temperare, "to moderate or keep within limit s" or "to mix." Most of the world's people live in the temperate zone-thatis, the zone where the temperature is moderate, bet ween the hot tropics and the icy Arctic and Antarctic Circles. It 's less easy to see how we get temperature from this root ; the word actually used to refer to the mixing of different basic element s in the body, and only slowly came to mean how hot or cold that body was.
 
temper              To dilute, qualify, or soften by adding something more agreeable; to moderate.


E.g.
 A wise parent tempers discipline with love.


The temper root keeps it s basic meaning-"to mix" or "to keep within limit s"-in the English word temper. When you temper something, you mix it with some balancing quality or substance so as to avoid anything extreme. Thus, it 's often said thata judge must temper justice with mercy. Young people only gradually learn to temper their natural enthusiasms with caution. And in dealing with others, we all try to temper our honesty with sensitivity.
 
temperance                   (1)  Moderation  in  satisfying  appetites  or  passions. (2)  The drinking of lit t le or no alcohol.


E.g.
 Buddhism teaches humankind to follow "the middle way"-thatis, temperance in all things.


Since temperance means basically "moderation," you mightassume that , with respect to alcohol, temperance would mean moderate consumption, or "social drinking." Instead, the word has usually meant the prohibition of all alcohol. To temperance leaders such as Carry Nation, the safest form of drinking was no alcohol atall. Believing she was upholding the law, Nation began her hatchet -swinging at tacks on saloons, known as "hatchetations,"  in  the  1890s. National prohibition did eventually come-and go-but largely through the effort s of  more temperate (thatis, moderate) reformers.
 
intemperate
      Not moderate or mild; excessive, extreme.


E.g.
 Lovers of fine wines and scotches are almost never intemperate drinkers.


Since the prefix in- generally means "not ," intemperate is the opposite of temperate. Someone intemperate reject s moderation in favor of excess. A religious fanatic is likely to preach with intemperate zeal, and a mean theater critic may become intemperate in her criticism of a new play, filling her review with intemperate language. And both temperate and intemperate also often refer to weather; a region with an intemperate climate isn't where all of us would choose to build a house.
 
distemper                         (1) A highly contagious viral disease, especially of dogs. (2) A highly contagious and usually fatal viral disease, especially of cat s, marked by the destruction of white blood cells.


E.g.
 An  epidemic  of  feline  distemper  had  swept  the  country,  and  it s  cat  population  had plummeted.


Back when doct ors believed that  our moods were affected by an imbalance of mysterious fluids in the body, or "humors," distemper often meant  moodiness, as when Shakespeare's Hamletis asked "Whatis the source of your distemperE.g.
" Today the word is used only for true physical conditions. The  distemper  that  affect s  dogs, often  called  canine  distemper, also affect s foxes, wolves, mink, raccoons, and ferret s. It  can be treated with medication, but  is generally fatal if not treated. Distemper in cat s, known as feline distemper or panleukopenia, actually isn'trelated to canine distemper. If caught quickly, it  t oo can be treated. And both  types  can  be  prevented  by  vaccination, so  all  responsible  pet  owners  get  their  animals vaccinated.
 
PURG comes from the Latin verb purgare, "to clean or cleanse." Almostall the English words where it shows up are closely related to those discussed below.
 
purge     (1) To clear of guilt or sin. (2) To free of something unwanted or considered impure.


E.g.
 During the 1930s, Stalin purged the Soviet communist party of thousands of members who he suspected of disloyalty.


In some cultures, a ritual bath or prayer is performed to purge guilt or evil spirit s. The Minoans of ancient Crete may have used human sacrifice as a way of purging the entire community, which is fine for the community butrough on the victims. In many cultures, people periodically purge themselves physically-thatis, clean out their  digestive  tract s-by  taking  strong laxatives; this used to be a popular springtime ritual, and herbal purgatives were readily available.
 
expurgate                         To cleanse of something morally harmful or offensive; to remove objectionable part s from.


E.g.
 In  those  years, high-school English  classes  only  used  expurgated  editions  of  Chaucer's
Canterbury Tales.


Expurgation has a long and questionable hist ory. Perhaps hist ory's most famous expurgator, or censor, was the English  edit or Thomas Bowdler, who in 1818 published the Family Shakespeare, an expurgated edition of Shakespeare's plays that omit ted or changed any passages that , in Bowdler's opinion, couldn't decent ly be read aloud in a family. As a result , the term bowdlerize is now a synonym of expurgate.
 
purgative               (1)  Cleansing  or  purifying,  especially  from  sin.  (2)  Causing  a significant looseness of the bowels.


E.g.
 I'm afraid my ten-year-old discovered the purgative effect of t oo many apples after a lazy afternoon in the orchard.


Purgative can be used as a noun as well as an adjective. For centuries, doct ors prescribed purgatives-thatis, laxatives-for all kinds of ailment s, not knowing anything bet ter to do. Physical cleansing has always reminded people of emotional and spiritual cleansing, as expressed in the saying "Cleanliness is next to godliness." So we may say, for example, that confession has a purgative effect on the soul. Some psychologist s used to claim thatexpressing your anger is purgative; butin factit may generally be no bet ter for your emotional life than taking a laxative, and can sometimes really foul things up.
 
purgat ory
(1) According to Roman Catholic doctrine, the place where the souls of those who have died in God's grace must pay for their sins through suffering before ascending to heaven. (2) A place or state of temporary suffering or misery.


E.g.
 For both of them, filled with anxiety, the long, sleepless night felt like purgat ory.


Purgatory is the place where the soul is cleansed of all impurities, as Dante described in his great poem The Divine Comedy. Today purgatory can refer to any place or situation in which suffering and misery are felt to be sharp but temporary. Waiting to hear the result s of a test , or whether you gota good job, can be a purgat ory. And an endless after-dinner speech can make an entire roomful of people feel as if they're in purgat ory.
 

 
Number Words

MILL means either "a thousand" or "a thousandth." A millennium is a thousand years, and a million  is a  thousand  thousands. But  a milligram is  a  thousandth  of  a  gram, a milliliter a thousandth of a liter, and a millimeter a thousandth of a meter.
 
millefleur                      Having a pat tern of small flowers and plant s all over.


E.g.
 She was painstakingly embroidering a millefleur pat tern on a pillow casing.


Millefleur came into French from the Latin mille florae ("a thousand flowers"), and from French direct ly into English. You may have seen the famed Unicorn Tapestries, in which the unicorn is seen frolicking, relaxing, being hunted, and being caught , all againsta beautiful millefleur background. Italian has given us the similar word millefiori; though fiori, like fleurs, means "flowers," millefiori actually refers to a type of multicolored ornamental glass. And the borrowed French word mille-feuille (feuille meaning "leaf") is the name of a dish made with puff pastry, the kind of pastry whose flakes resemble thin dry leaves.
 
millenarianism
             (1) Belief  in  the  1,000-year era  of  holiness foret old in the Book of Revelation. (2) Belief in an ideal society to come, especially one broughtabout by revolution.


E.g.
 Millenarianism is one of the future-oriented beliefs common in the New Age movement .


Originally the millennium was not simply any thousand-year period, butinstead the thousand years prophesied in the biblical Book of Revelation, when holiness will prevail on earth and Jesus Christ will preside over all. Later, millennium was extended to mean any period-always in the future-marked by universal happiness and human perfection. On several occasions over the centuries, members of Christian sect s have become convinced that the biblical millennium was arriving and gathered t ogether to awaitit . But nonreligious millenarians have also believed in a future society marked by human perfection. Even if they regard this future as certain, they've generally been willing to help italong by working for a political, social, or economic revolution. The millennium always seems to be approaching; to date, ithasn'tarrived.
 
millipede                Any of a class of many-footed arthropods thathave a cylindrical, segmented body with two pairs of legs on each segment , and, unlike centipedes, no poison fangs.


E.g.
 As they turned over rocks and bricks in their search for the lost bracelet , millipedes of various sizes went scurrying off.


The earth is home to about 10,000 species of millipedes. Though they have no poison fangs, many of them can, when threatened, emita liquid or gas poisonous to their enemies. If their structure were true to their name, millipedes would have a thousand legs, butin fact they have far fewer. Even so, a millipede in motion is a sight to ponder: How can it possibly coordinate all those legs so thatit doesn't trip over it selfE.g.
 Like some tiny conga line or bunny hop, it scut t les away to a rhythm only it can hear.
 
millisecond
  One thousandth of a second.


E.g.
 A light ning bolt last s only about 20 milliseconds, though the image may stay in one's eye for much longer.


A millisecond isn't long enough for the blink of an eye, buta few milliseconds may determine the winner of a swim race or a hundred-yard dash. With the ever-increasing speed of modern technology, even a millisecond has started to seem a lit t le sluggish; computer operations are now measured in nanoseconds-thatis, billionths of a second.
 
HEMI/SEMI means "half." Hemi- comes from Greek, semi- from Latin. A hemisphere is half a sphere, and a semicircle is half a circle. (The French prefix demi-, which probably developed from Latin as well, also means "half"-as in demitasse, a lit t le after-dinner coffee cup half the size of a regular cup.)
 
semit one
 The t one ata half step.


E.g.
 The ancient piano in the great music room had been allowed to fall terribly out of t une, with every note at leasta semit one flat .


A semit one (sometimes called a half tone or a half step) is the distance from a white key to a neighboring black key on the piano keyboard-for example, from G to G-sharp or from E to E- flat . In an octave (from G to the next G above, for instance), there are t welve semit ones. Semit ones are the smallestintervals thatare used intentionally in almostany of the music you'll normally hear. Two semit ones equal a whole tone-the distance from G up to A or from E down to D, for example.
 
semicolon The  punctuation  mark  ; , used  chiefly to separate  major sentence element s such as independent clauses.


E.g.
 Some young vandal had done a search-and-replace on Mr. Marsh's computer file, and in place of every semicolon was the mysterious message "Hendrix RULES!"


The semicolon was introduced into modern type by an Italian printer around 1566. But since it 's actually the same symbol as the ancient  Greek question mark, it 's older than the colon (:), which firstappears around 1450. Don't mix the two up. A colon introduces something: usually a list , sometimes a statement . A semicolon separates two independent butrelated clauses; it may also replace the comma to separate items in a complicated list .
 
hemiplegia
Total or partial paralysis of one side of the body thatresult s from disease of or injury to the mot or centers of the brain.


E.g.
 She's starting to regain the use of her righthand, and some of the therapist s think her hemiplegia mighteventually be reversed.


Hemi-, unlike semi, almost  always appears in scientific or technical words, including medical terms such as this one. A hemiplegic, like a paraplegic (who has lost the use of both legs), has usually suffered brain damage, often from a wound or blood clot . Other conditions thataffect one side of the body are hemihypertrophy (excessive growth  on  one  side), hemiatrophy (wasting on one side), and hemiparesis (weakness or partial paralysis).
 
semiconduct or
         A solid that conduct s electricity like a metal athigh temperatures and insulates like a nonmetal at low temperatures.


E.g.
 Silicon, which makes up 25% of the earth's crust , is the most widely used semiconduct or, and as such has formed the basis for a revolution in human culture.


A  semiconduct or  is  a  crystal  material  whose  ability to conduct  electricity  rises  as  it s temperature goes up. Thatis, it sometimes act s as a conduct or  and  sometimes  as  an insulat or. It s conducting ability can be much increased by chemical treat ment . A manufactured chip of silicon, less than half an inch square, may contain millions of microscopic transist ors, which can serve control and memory functions when installed in a computer, aut omobile, cell phone, DVD player, or microwave oven.

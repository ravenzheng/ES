MAND UND SANCT LOQU VIR VAL CRE/CRET FUS GreekandLatinBorrowings
Quiz24-1 Quiz24-2 Quiz24-3 Quiz24-4 Quiz24-5 ReviewQuizzes24

MAND comes from mandare, Latin for "entrust " or "order." A command is an order; a commandmentis also an order, but usually one that comes from God. And a commando unit carries out orders for special military actions.
 
mandate                          (1) A formal command. (2) Permission to act , given by the people to their representatives.


E.g.
 The new president claimed his landslide vict ory was a mandate from the voters to end the war.


A mandate from a leader is a command you can'trefuse. But that kind of personal command is rarely the meaning of mandate t oday; much more common are connected with instit utions. Thus, the Clean Air Act was a mandate from Congress to clean up air pollution-and since mandate is also a verb, we could say instead that the Clear Air Act mandated new restrictions on air pollution. Elections are often interpreted as mandates from the public for certain kinds of action. But since a politician is not justa symbol of certain policies butalso an individual who mighthappen to have an awfully nice smile, it can be risky to interpret mostelections as mandating anything atall.
 
mandat ory
Required.


E.g.
 If at tendance at the meeting hadn't been mandat ory, she would have just gone home.


Something mandat ory is the result of a mandate or order, which usually comes in the form of a law, rule, or regulation. Today there seem to be a lot of these mandates, so mandat ory seat belt s, mandat ory inspections for industries, and mandat ory prison sentences for violent crimes are regularly in the news. But mandat ory retirementatage 65, which used to be common, is now illegal in most cases.
 
commandeer
 To take possession of  something by force, especially for military purposes.


E.g.
 No sooner had they started their meeting than the boss showed up and commandeered the conference room.


Military forces have always had the power to commandeer houses. The Declaration of Independence complains about the way the British soldiers have done it , and the third Amendment to the Constit ution states that the commandeering of people's houses shall be done only in a way prescribed by law. Almostanything-food, supplies, livest ock, et c.-can be militarily commandeered when the need arises. Butyou don'thave to be in the military for someone to "pull rank" on you: Your father may commandeer the car just when you were about to take it out for the evening, your teacher may commandeer your cell phone as you're texting in the middle of class, or your older sister may commandeer the TV remote to watch some lousy dancing competition.
 
remand                    (1) To order a case sent back to another court or agency for further action. (2) To send a prisoner back into cust ody to await further trial or sentencing.


E.g.
 The state supreme courthad remanded the case to the superior court , instructing it to consider the new evidence.


Remand means "order back" or "send back." After losing a case in a lower court , lawyers will frequent ly appeal it to a higher court . If the higher court looks at the case and sees that the lower court made certain kinds of errors, it will simply remand it , while telling the lower courthow it  fell short  the first  time: by not  instructing the jury thoroughly, for example, or by not taking into accounta recentrelated court decision.
 
UND comes into English from the Latin words unda, "wave," and undare, "to rise in waves," "to surge or flood." Undulations are waves or wavelike things or motions, and to undulate is to rise and fall in a wavelike way.
 
undulant                           (1) Rising and falling in waves. (2) Wavy in form, out line, or surface.


E.g.
 The man's undulant , sinister movement s reminded her of a poisonous snake about to strike.


The surface of a freshly plowed field is undulant . A range of rolling hills could  be  called undulant , as could the shifting sands of the Sahara. A waterbed mat tress is often literally undulant . And a field of wheat will undulate or sway in the wind, like the waves of the sea.
 
inundate                           (1) To cover with a flood or overflow. (2) To overwhelm.


E.g.
 As news of the singer's death spread, retailers were inundated with orders for all his old recordings.


In the summer of 1993, record rains in the Midwest caused the Mississippi River to overflow it s banks, break through levees, and inundate the entire countryside; such an inundation hadn't been seen for at leasta hundred years. By contrast , the Nile River inundated it s entire valley every year, bringing the rich black silt that made the valley one of the most fertile places on earth. (The inundations ceased with the completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970.) Whenever a critical issue is being debated, the White House and Congressional offices are inundated with phone calls and e-mails, justas a t own may be inundated with complaint s when it start s charging a fee for garbage pickup.
 
redound                        (1) To have an effect for good or bad. (2) To rebound or reflect .


E.g.
 Each new military vict ory redounded to the glory of the king, whose brilliance as a leader was now praised and feared throughout Europe.


Redound has had a confusing hist ory. It s original meaning was simply "overflow." But since the prefix re- often means "back," the later meaning "result " may have arisen because flowing back
-on a beach, for example-is a result of the original flowing. Redound has long been confused with other words such as resound and rebound, so t oday "rebound" is another of it s standard meanings. As examples of it s usual meaning, we could say that the prohibition of alcohol in 1919 redounded unintentionally to the benefit of gangsters such as Al Capone-and that Capone's  jailing  on  tax-evasion  charges  redounded to the   credit   of   the   famous "Unt ouchables."
 
redundancy
 (1) The state of being extra or unnecessary. (2) Needless repetition.


E.g.
 A certain amount of redundancy can help make a speaker's point s clear, but t oo much can be annoying.


Redundancy, closely related to redound, has stayed close to the original meaning of "overflow" or "more than necessary." Avoiding redundancy is one of the prime rules of good writing. ""In the modern world of t oday" contains a redundancy; so does "He died of fatal wounds" and "For the mutual benefit of both parties." Butredundancy doesn't just occur in language. "Data redundancy" means keeping the same computer data in more than one place as a safety measure, and a backup system in an airplane may provide redundancy, again for the sake of safety.
 

 
SANCT, meaning "holy," comes from the Latin word sanctus. Thus, sanctity means "holiness." In ancient Greece, a spot could be sanctified, or "made holy," by a group of priest s who carried outa solemn ritual; these might be spot s where fumes arose from a crack in the earth or where a spring of clear water flowed out of the ground, and a temple might be built there for worship of a god.
 
sanction
 To give approval t o.


E.g.
 The bill's opponent s claimed thatremoving criminal penalties for drug possession would amount to sanctioning drug use.


Sanction originally meant "make holy" or "give official church approval t o." The word still has a solemn sound to it , so sanctioning is something generally done by an instit ution or government , though not necessarily by a church. So a college may sanction-or "give it s blessing t o"-the use of office space by a gay organization, or a hot -rod association may sanction two new tracks for official races. But sanction is also a noun, which may have two near-opposite meanings, "approval" and "penalty." Thus, a company may be accused of giving it s sanction to illegal activities. But when two or more countries impose sanctions on another country, it often involves cut ting off trade. No wonder sanction is such a tricky word for so many of us.
 
sanctimonious
   Pretending to be more religiously observant  or morally bet ter than other people.


E.g.
 The candidates' speeches were sanctimonious from beginning to end, filled with st ories abouthow their deep faith was the basis for everything they did.


Making a show of your religious morality has always struck some people the wrong way, including Jesus. In his Sermon on the Mount , Jesus preaches that , when we give away money for charity, we shouldn't let our lefthand know what our righthand is doing-thatis, the giving should be done for it s own sake and other people shouldn't be t old aboutit . Those who make a display of how good and pious they are called hypocrites. But sanctimony, or sanctimoniousness, has often been a good strategy for American politicians, many of whom have found ita great way to win votes.
 
sacrosanct                         (1) Most sacred or holy. (2) Treated as if holy and therefore immune from criticism or disturbance of any kind.


E.g.
 Lot s of expert s have criticized the governor's education program, butit 's regarded as sacrosanct by members of her own party.


Sacrosanct means literally "made holy by a sacred rite," and in it s original use the word was reserved for things of the ut mostholiness. But sacrosanct  is  now  used to describe  a questionable sacredness which nevertheless makes something immune  from  at tack  or violation; thatis, the person using the word usually doesn'tregard the thing as sacred atall. So to call a government program sacrosanctis to imply that others regard itas unt ouchable. And a piece of writing is more likely to be thought of as sacrosanct by it s author than by the edit or who has to fix it up.
 
sanctuary
  (1) A holy place, such as a church or temple, or the mostholy part of one. (2) A place of safety, refuge, and protection.


E.g.
 The midt own park is a tranquil sanctuary amidst the city's heat , noise, and bust le.


Hist orically, churches have been places  where  fugitives  could  seek  at  least  temporary protection from the law. In Anglo-Saxon England, churches and churchyards generally provided 40 days of immunity, and neither the sheriffs nor the army would enter to seize the out law. But gradually the right of sanctuary was eroded. In 1486 sanctuary for the crime of treason was disallowed, and sanctuary for most other crimes was severely restricted by Henry V I and later abolished. In the 1980s many U.S. churches provided sanctuary to political refugees from Central America, and the U.S. government most ly chose not to interfere. Today, wildlife sanctuaries provide protection for the species within it s  boundaries,  and  farm-animal sanctuaries now rescue livest ock from abuse and starvation.
 
LOQU comes from the Latin verb loqui, "to talk." An eloquent preacher speaks fluent ly, forcefully, and expressively. And a dummy's words come out of a ventriloquist's mouth-or perhaps out of his belly (in Latin, venter).
 
colloquium
      A conference in which various speakers take turns lecturing on a subjectand then answering questions aboutit .


E.g.
 There's a colloquium at Yale on Noah Webster in September, where she's scheduled to deliver a paper.


A colloquy is a conversation, and especially an important , high-level discussion. Colloquy and colloquium once meant the same thing, though t oday colloquium always refers to a conference. Because of it s old "conversation" meaning, however, a colloquium is a type of conference with important question-and-answer periods.
 
soliloquy
  A dramatic speech thatrepresent s a series of unspoken thought s.


E.g.
 Film characters never have onscreen soliloquies, though they may tell us their thought s in a voiceover.


Since solus means "alone" in Latin, soliloquies take place when a character is alone onstage, or maybe spot lighted off to one side of a dark stage. Novels have no trouble in expressing to the reader a character's personal thought s, but such expression is less natural to stage drama. The soliloquies of Shakespeare-in Hamlet ("To be or not to be"), Macbeth ("Tomorrow and  t omorrow and t omorrow"), Romeo and Juliet ("But soft ! what light from yonder window breaks"), et c.-are the most famous, but modern playwright s such as Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, and Sam Shepard have also employed them.
 
colloquial
    Conversational in style.


E.g.
 The author, though obviously a professional writer, uses a colloquial style in this new book.


Since colloquy means basically "conversation," colloquial language is the language almostall of us speak. It uses contractions ("can't ," "it 's," "they've"), possibly some slang, lot s of short words and not many long ones. But our language usually changes when we write, becoming more formal and sometimes even "literary." Exceptin e-mails and text messages, many people never write a contraction or use the word "I", and avoid informal words completely. But colloquial language isn't necessarily  bad  in  writing, and  it 's  sometimes  more  appropriate than the alternative.
 
loquacious
    Apt to talk t oo much; talkative.


E.g.
 She had hoped to read quiet ly on the plane, but the loquacious salesman in the next seat made it nearly impossible.


A loquacious speaker can leave a big audience stifling it s yawns after the first 45 minutes, and the loquaciousness of a dinner guest can keep everyone else from get ting a word in edgewise. Loquacious let ters used to go on for pages, and a loquacious author might produce a 1,200- page novel. Lincoln's brief 269-word Get tysburg Address was delivered after  a t wo-hour, 13,000-word speech by America's most famous orat or, a windbag of loquacity.
 

 
VIR is Latin for "man." A virtue is a good quality-originally, the kind of quality an ideal man possessed. And virtuous behavior is morally excellent . All in all, the Romans seem to have believed that being a man was a good thing.
 
virility                          Energetic, vigorous manhood; masculinity.


E.g.
 For his entire life he believed thatanyone who had been a Marine had established his virility beyond any doubt .


Luckily, there's no doubtabout what virility is, since it 's depicted on the covers of dozens of new romance novels every month! A masterful and dominating manner, a splendid bared chest , a full head of lustrous hair, and an array of st unning cost umes seem to be what 's required. (Virile trait s often missing in these men are hair on the chestand any hint of future baldness.) High-school foot ball provides a showplace for demonstrations of adolescent virility, and for years afterward virile high-school players can keep using foot ball language in their business life: "get to the red zone," "Hail Mary pass," "move the ball," and on and on.
 
triumvirate                       (1) A commission or government  of  three. (2) A group or association of three.


E.g.
 A triumvirate slowly emerged as the inner circle of the White House, and the vice president wasn'tamong them.


The first triumvirate of the Roman Republic, which consisted of Julius Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus, was simply an alliance or part nership, nota formal instit ution of the government . The alliance didn't last long, however, and Caesar eventually emerged with t otal power. This led to his assassination, after which a second triumvirate t ook over, with Octavian, Mark Ant ony, and Lepidus dividing the Roman world among themselves. But these triumvirs also soon turned on one another, with Octavian alone taking power; in time he would become Rome's firstemperor.
 
virago                         A loud, bad-tempered, overbearing woman.


E.g.
 The staff called her a virago and other things behind her back, buteveryone was respect ful of her abilities.


The original Latin meaning of virago was "female warrior." Butin later centuries the meaning shifted t oward the negative. The most famous virago in English literature is the ferocious Kate in Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew. Some hist orical viragoes have also become famous. Agrippina poisoned her husband, the Emperor Claudius, so that  her son Nero could take his place (butit was Nero himself who eventually had her assassinated). And Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, a powerful virago of the 12th century, was imprisoned by her husband, King Henry I of England, after she encouraged their sons to rebel againsthim. Today some people are beginning to use virago admiringly again.
 
virt uosity
      Great technical skill, especially in the practice of a fine art .


E.g.
 Playing with the band, his virt uosity doesn't show through; you really have to hear him solo to appreciate him.


Virtuosity is used particularly to describe musicians, butalso often for writers, act ors, dancers, and athletes. A virtuoso is a highly skilled performer, and a virtuoso performance is one thatast onishes the audience by it s feat s. In ancient Greece the  cities  would  hold  male competitions in acrobatics, conjuring, public reciting, blowing the trumpet , and acting out scenes from Homer's epics, the winners of which would have been praised as virtuous, or "full of manly virt ues."
 
VAL has as it s basic meaning "strength," from the Latin verb valere, meaning "to be worthy, healthy, or strong" and  "to  have  power  or  influence."  So evaluating  a  house  involves determining how healthy itis. A valid license or credit card is one that 's still in effect , and a valid proof is one that provides strong evidence.
 
valor                  Personal bravery in the face of danger.


E.g.
 The gun duels of the Old West were invented by a novelistinspired by the valor of the knight s in medieval t ournament s.


Valor in uniform is still rewarded by medals. Many American civic organizations award a Medal of Valor for physical courage, and the Air Force Medal of Honor displays the single word "Valor." The somewhat old-fashioned adjective valorous more often describes warriors of the past . But valiantis still in common use, though it less often describes military courage than other kinds of bravery or effort .
 
equivalent
  (1) Equal in force, amount , value, area, or volume. (2) Similar or virtually identical in effect or function.


E.g.
 A square can be equivalent to a triangle in area, but notin shape.


Modern democracies have instit utions and offices thatare roughly equivalent to those found in others: the president of the United States has his British equivalentin the prime minister, for instance, and the U.S. Congress finds it s equivalentin the British Parliament . The heavily armored knight on his greatarmored horse has been called the Middle Ages' equivalent of the army tank. In none of these examples are the two things identical to each other; they're simply very similar in their effect or purpose or nature, which is whatequivalence usually implies.
 
prevalent
  Widely accepted, favored, or practiced; widespread.


E.g.
 On some campuses Frisbees seem to be more prevalent than schoolbooks, especially in the spring.


Many diseases that were prevalenta century ago have been controlled by advances in medicine. Smallpox was prevalent on several continent s for many centuries, and when Europeans broughtit with them to the Americas, it killed more American Indians than the armed set t lers did. But prevalent doesn't just describe diseases. One ideal of male or female beauty may be prevalentin a particular society and quite a differentideal in another. In the 1950s and '60s, there was a prevalent notion thatif you went swimming less than an hour after eating you might drown because of st omach cramps-which goes to show that notevery prevalentidea is exact ly true.
 
validate                 (1) To make legally valid; give official approval t o. (2) To support or confirm the validity of.


E.g.
 It will take many more research st udies to validate a theory as far-reaching as this one.


Validating a pass might  require get ting an official stamp on it . Validating experimental data mightrequire checking itagainst data from further experiment s. An A on a test might validate your st udy methods. And you might go to a trusted friend to validate your decision to getrid of your boyfriend, buy a petiguana, or sell everything and move to Las Vegas.
 

 
CRE/CRET comes from the Latin verb crescere, which means both "to come into being" and "to grow." So a crescendo in music occurs when the music is growing louder, and a decrescendo when it 's growing softer.
 
crescent                         (1) The moon bet ween the new moon and first quarter, and bet ween the last quarter and the next new moon. (2) Anything shaped like the crescent moon.


E.g.
 The symbol of Islam is a crescent moon with a star bet ween the point s, an astronomical impossibility.


Crescent means basically "growing," since a crescent moon is in the process of "growing" to a full moon. A crescent wrench, with it s open end (unlike the kind of wrench thathas an almost circular end), can be found in almostany household. A croissant, or crescent pastry, is a breakfast staple. The curving region called the Fertile Crescent , which stretches from the Persian Gulf up through Iraq, across to Lebanon and Israel, and down into Egypt 's Nile River valley, was the birthplace of civilization, where weaving, pot tery, domesticated livest ock, irrigation farming, and writing all firstappeared.
 
accretion                         (1) Growth or enlargement by gradual buildup. (2) A product of such buildup.


E.g.
 The house and barn were linked by an accretion of out buildings, each joined to the next .


The slow accretion of scientific knowledge over many centuries has turned into an avalanche in our time. Any accretion of ice on a grounded jet will resultin takeoff delays because of the danger it poses. The land area of the Mississippi Delta increases every year from the accretion of soil washed down the Mississippi River, though the accretions happen so slowly thatit 's difficult to detectany increase atall. Accretion is often used in scientific writing; it s usual verb form, accrue, is more often used in financial context s ("This figure doesn't count the accrued interest on the invest ment s").
 
excrescence                   (1) A projection of growth, especially when abnormal. (2) A disfiguring, unnecessary, or unwanted mark or part .


E.g.
 The new warehouse squat ted like some hideous excrescence on the landscape.


Wart s and pimples are common excrescences that can usually be wiped out with medication; other excrescences such as cyst s and t umors need to be removed surgically. Mushrooms are the excrescences of underground fungus net works. Some people consider slang words to be vulgar excrescences on the English language, but others consider slang the most colorful vocabulary of all.
 
increment                       (1) Something gained or added, especially as one of a series of regular additions or  as a tiny increase in amount . (2)  The amount or  extent of change, especially the positive or negative change in value of one or more variables.


E.g.
 Her bank accounthas grown weekly by increment s of $50 for the past two years.


Incrementis used in many technical fields, butalso nontechnically. Incremental increases in drug dosages are used for experimental purposes. Incremental tax increases are easier to swallow than sudden large increases. Incremental changes of any kind may be hard to notice, but can be very significantin the long run. Rome wasn't builtin a day, but was instead built up by increment s from a couple of villages  in  the  10th  century  B.C. to the  capital  of  the Mediterranean world in the 1st century A.D.
 
FUS comes from the Latin verb fundere, "to pour out " or "to melt ." A fuse depends on melting metal to break an overloaded circuit . Nuclear fusion involves the "melting" t ogether of light nuclei to form heavier nuclei, and fusion cuisine brings t ogether the cooking of two or more cultures.
 
transfusion
 (1) The process of transferring a fluid and especially blood into a blood vessel. (2) Something transfused.


E.g.
 The transfusion gave her an immediate burst of energy, and her friends were ast onished when they arrived at the hospital thatafternoon.


When blood transfusions were firstat tempted by Europeans in the early 1600s, they were met with skepticism, since the established practice was to bleed patient s, not transfuse them with blood. Some patient s were transfused with animal blood, and so many died as a result that by 1700 transfusions had been widely out lawed. Not until 1900 were the major blood groups (A, B, AB, and O) recognized, making transfusions safe and effective.
 
effusive                       (1) Given to excessive display of feeling. (2) Freely expressed.


E.g.
 At the vict ory party she lavished effusive praise on all her supporters for almosthalf an hour.


Since to effuse is to "pour out ," an effusive person makes a habit of pouring outemotions. Greeting someone effusively may include greathugs and wet kisses. Academy Award winners  tend to become embarrassingly effusive once they've got the microphone. Butat leasteffusiveness is generally an expression of positive rather than negative emotions.
 
profusion
      Greatabundance.


E.g.
 In May the trees and flowers bloom with almost delirious profusion.


A profusion is literally a "pouring forth," so a profusion of gift s is a wealth or abundance of gift s. A profusely illustrated book is filled to overflowing with pictures. A bad social error should be followed   by profuse  apologies, and  profound  gratit ude  should  be  expressed  with  profuse thanks.
 
suffuse                      To spread over or fill something, as if by fluid or light .


E.g.
 As the soft light of dawn suffused the landscape, they could hear the loons crying over the lake.


The odors of baking may suffuse a room, and so may the light of a sunset . A face may be suffused (thatis, filled, butalso probably flushed) with joy, or hope, or love. A novel may be suffused with Irish humor, and a room may be suffused with firelight . Scientist s may even describe an insect 's gray wings as being suffused with tinges of red.
 

 
Greek and Latin Borrowings

apologia
     A defense, especially of one's own ideas, opinions, or actions.


E.g.
 His resignation speech was an eloquentapologia for his controversial actions as chairman.


An apologia and an apology usually aren't the same thing. An apology includes an admission of wrongdoing, butan apologia rarely apologizes in this sense, instead seeking to justify what was done. So, for example, in 1992 some of the books published for the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage were apologias explaining why European powers such as Spain acted as they did in the New World: because, for example, the Aztecs were a cruel people, practicing human sacrifice in grotesque ways (victims were skinned, and their skins were worn by the high priest s), and Christianity hoped to reform them. Of course, the Spanish Inquisition was t orturing and executing nonbelievers at the same time-but that would be the subject of other apologias.
 
atrium                      (1) An open rectangular patio around which a house is built . (2) A court with a skylightin a many-st oried building.


E.g.
 Best of all, their new home had a large atrium, where they could eat breakfastin the fresh air in spring and summer.


In malls and grand office buildings t oday, the enclosed atrium, often with full-size trees growing in itand high indoor balconies with hanging vines, has become a common architectural feature. But the original atria (notice the unusual plural) were open to the sky and occupied the center of a house or villa in ancientrome. The open Roman courtyard allowed air to circulate and light to enter, and even it s plantings helped cool the house. Situating the cooking fireplace in the atrium was another way of keeping the house it self cool. Still t oday, houses around the Mediterranean Sea and in tropical Latin America often have internal courtyards.
 
oligarchy
   A governmentin which power is in the hands of a small group.


E.g.
 The population was shackled by an iron-willed oligarchy that dictated every aspect of their lives and ruthlessly crushed any hint of rebellion.


Oligarchy combines root s from the Greek words oligos, meaning "few," and archos, meaning "leader or ruler." In ancient Greece, an aristocracy was government by the "best " (in Greek, aristos) citizens. An oligarchy was a corrupted arist ocracy, one in which a few evil men unjust ly seized power and used it to further their own ends. Since at least 1542, oligarchy has been used in English to describe oppressive government s of the kind that serve the interest s of a few very wealthy families.
 
encomium
 Glowing, enthusiastic praise, or an expression of such praise.


E.g.
 The surprise  guestat the  farewell party was the  school's most famous graduate, who delivered a heart feltencomium to the woman he called his favorite teacher of all.


Encomium comes straight from Latin. Mark Ant ony's encomium to the dead Caesar in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar ("Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears") is one of the most famous encomiums of all time, while Ben Jonson's encomium to the dead Shakespeare ("He was not of an age, but for all time") has also been widely read and discussed. The British poet laureate is expected to compose poetic encomiums to mark special event s or to praise a person honored by the state. And any awards banquet  is thick with encomiums, with each speaker trying to out do the lastin praise of those being honored.
 
neurosis                       A mental and emotional disorder thatis less severe than a psychosis and may involve various pains, anxieties, or phobias.


E.g.
 He has a neurosis about dirt , and is constant ly washing his hands.


A neurosis is a somewhat mild mental disorder; unexplained anxiety at tacks, unreasonable fears, depression, and physical sympt oms thatare mentally caused are all examples of neurotic conditions. A superstitious person who compulsively knocks on wood or avoids anything with the number 13 might be suffering from a harmless neurosis. Buta severe neurosis such as agoraphobia (see agoraphobia) can be very harmful, making a person a prisoner of his or her home. Neurosis is based on the Greek word for "nerve," since until quite recent ly neurotic behavior was often blamed on the nerves. Neurosis is usually contrasted with psychosis, which includes a considerably more serious group of conditions.
 
opprobrium
(1) Something that brings disgrace. (2) A public disgrace thatresult s from conduct considered wrong or bad.


E.g.
 The writers of the New Testamenthold the Pharisees up to opprobrium for their hypocrisy and hollow spirituality.


Witches have long been the object s of opprobrium; in Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries, women  thought to be  witches  were  burned  by  the  thousands. The opprobrious  crime  of treason could likewise resultin the mosthideous t orture and execution. In The Scarlet Letter, the sin of adultery in Puritan times brought opprobrium on Hester Prynne. Today the country of Israel is the object of opprobrium in many countries, while the Palestinians suffer similar opprobrium in others. And mere smokers, or even overweight  people, may sometimes feel themselves to be the object s of mild opprobrium.
 
referendum                          (1) The referring of legislative measures to the voters for approval or rejection. (2) A vote on such a measure.


E.g.
 The referendum on the tax needed for constructing the new hospital passed by seven votes.


Referendum is a Latin word, butit s modern meaning only dates from the 19th century, when a new constit ution adopted by Swit zerland stated that the voters could vote direct ly on certain issues. Thus, a referendum is a measure that 's referred (thatis, sent on) to the people. Since the U.S. Constit ution doesn't provide for referenda (notice the common plural form) at the national level, referenda tend to be on local and state issues. In most locales, a few questions usually appear on the ballotatelection time, often involving such issues as new zoning ordinances, new taxes for schools, and new limit s on spending.
 
ultimat um
 A final proposal, condition, or demand, especially one whose rejection will resultin forceful action.


E.g.
 The ultimat um to Iraq in 1991 demanding thatit withdraw from Kuwait was ignored, and a U.S.-led invasion was the response.


An ultimat um is usually issued by a stronger power to a weaker one, since it wouldn't carry much weightif the one giving the ultimat um couldn't back up it s threat . Near the end of World War I, the Allied powers issued an ultimat um to Japan: surrender completely or face the consequences. Japan rejected the ultimat um, and within days the U.S. had dropped at omic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing some 200,000 people.

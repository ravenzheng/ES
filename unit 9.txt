HER FUG COSM SCI JUNCT PART MIS PEL WordsfromMythology
Quiz9-1 Quiz9-2 Quiz9-3 Quiz9-4 Quiz9-5 ReviewQuizzes9

HER comes from the Latin verb haerere, meaning "to stick." Another form of the verb produces the roothes-, seen in such words as adhesive, which means basically "sticky" or "sticking," and hesitate, which means more or less "st uck in one place."
 
adherent (1) Someone who follows a leader, a party, or a profession. (2) One who believes in a particular philosophy or religion.


E.g.
 The general's adherent s heavily out numbered his opponent s and managed to shout them down repeatedly.


Justas tape adheres to paper, a person may adhere to a cause, a faith, or a belief. Thus, you may be an adherent  of Hinduism, an adherent  of environmentalism, or an adherent  of the Republican Party. A plan for cut ting taxes always at tract s adherent s easily, regardless of what  the cut s may resultin.
 
cohere                  To hold t ogether firmly as part s of the same mass.


E.g.
 His novels never really cohere; the chapters always seem like separate short st ories.


When you finish writing a paper, you may feel thatit coheres well, since it 's sharply focused and all the ideas seem to supporteach other. When all the soldiers in an army plat oon feel like buddies, the plat oon has become a cohesive unit . In science class you may learn the difference bet ween cohesion (the tendency of a chemical's molecules to stick t ogether) and adhesion (the tendency of the molecules of two different substances to stick t ogether). Water molecules tend to cohere, so water falls from the sky in drops, notas separate molecules. But water molecules also adhere to molecules of other substances, so raindrops will often cling to the underside of a clothesline for a while before gravity pulls them down.
 
incoherent                      (1) Unclear or difficult to understand. (2) Loosely organized or inconsistent .


E.g.
 The police had found him in an abandoned warehouse, and they reported thathe was dirty, hungry, and incoherent .


Incoherentis the opposite of coherent, and both commonly refer to words and thought s. Justa s coherent means well ordered and clear, incoherent means disordered and hard to follow. Incoherence in speech may result from emotional stress, especially anxiety or anger. Incoherence in writing may simply result from poor planning; a t welve-page term paper thatisn't writ ten until the night before it 's due will generally suffer from incoherence.
 
inherent                         Part of something by nature or habit .


E.g.
 A guiding belief behind our Constit ution is thatindividuals have certain inherentright s that can't be taken away.


Inherent literally refers to something thatis "st uck in" something else so firmly that they can't be separated. A plan may have an inherent flaw that will cause it to fail; a person may have inherent virt ues thateveryone admires. Since the flaw and the virt ues can't be removed, the plan may simply have to be thrown outand the person will remain virt uous forever.
 
FUG comes from the Latin verb fugere, meaning "to flee or escape." Thus, a refugee flees from some threat or danger, while a fugitive is usually fleeing from the law.
 
centrifugal
 Moving out ward from a center or central focus.


E.g.
 Their favorite carnival ride was the Round-up, in which centrifugal force flat tened them against the outer wall of a rapidly spinning cage.


Centrifugal force is what keeps a string with a ball on the end taut when you whirl itaround. A centrifuge is a machine that uses centrifugal force. At the end of a washing machine's cycle, it becomes a weak and simple centrifuge as it whirls the water out of your clothes. Centrifuges hundreds of thousands of times as powerful are essential to nuclear technology and drug manufacturing. Part of an astronaut 's training occurs in a centrifuge that generates force equal to several times the force of gravity (about like a washing machine) to get them used to the forces they'll encounter in a real space mission.
 
refuge                Shelter or protection from danger or distress, or a place that  provides shelter or protection.


E.g.
 Caughtin a st orm by surprise, they t ook refuge in an abandoned barn.


The re- in refuge means basically "back" or "backward" rather than "again" (see RE-); thus, a refugee is someone who is "fleeing backward." Refuge tends to appear with certain other words: you generally "seek refuge," "take refuge," or "find refuge." Religion may be a refuge from the woes of your life; a beautiful park may be a refuge from the noise of the city; and your bedroom may be a refuge from the madness of your family.
 
fugue             A  musical  form  in  which  a  theme  is  echoed  and  imitated  by  voices  or instrument s thatenter one after another and interweave as the piece proceeds.


E.g.
 For his debut on the church's new organ, the organistchose a fugue by J. S. Bach.


Bach and Handel composed many fugues for harpsichord and organ in which the various part s (or voices) seem to flee from and chase each other in an intricate dance. Each part , after ithas stated the theme or melody, apparent ly flees from the next part , which takes up the same theme and set s off in pursuit . Simple rounds such as "Three Blind Mice" or "Row, Row, Row Your Boat " could be called fugues for children, buta true fugue can be long and extremely complex.
 
subterfuge                        (1) A trick designed to help conceal, escape, or evade. (2) A deceptive trick.


E.g.
 The conservatives' subterfuge of funding a liberal third-party candidate in order to take votes away from the main liberal candidate almost worked thatyear.


With it s "flee" root , the Latin verb subterfugere meant "to escape or avoid." Thus, a subterfuge is a way of escaping blame, embarrassment , inconvenience-or even prison-by tricky means. The life of spies consist s of an endless series of subterfuges. In the more everyday world, put ting words like "heart -healthy" on junk-food packaging is a subterfuge to trick unwary shoppers. And get ting a friend to call aboutan "emergency" in order to get out of an evening engagementis about the oldest subterfuge in the book.
 

 
COSM comes from the Greek word for "order." Since the Greeks believed the universe was an orderly place, words in this group usually relate to the universe. So cosmonaut was the word for a space traveler from the former Soviet Union. (The root s of our own word, astronaut, suggest "star traveler"  instead.) Oddly enough, cosmetics comes from the same root , since put ting things in order is similar to decorating something-such as your face.
 
cosmos                        (1)  The  universe,  especially  when  it  is  viewed  as  orderly  and systematic. (2) Any orderly system thatis complete in it self.


E.g.
 The astronomer, the biologist , and the philosopher all try in their own ways to make sense of the cosmos.


Cosmos often simply means "universe." But the word is generally used to suggestan orderly or harmonious universe, as it was originally used by Pythagoras in the 6th century B.C. Thus, a religious mystic may help put us in t ouch with the cosmos, and so may a physicist . The same is often true of the adjective cosmic: Cosmic rays (really particles rather than rays) bombard us from outer space, but cosmic questions come from human at tempt s to find order in the universe.
 
cosmology                         (1) A theory that describes the nature of the universe. (2) A branch of astronomy that deals with the origin and structure of the universe.


E.g.
 New Age teachers propose a cosmology quite unlike the traditional Jewish, Christian, or Islamic ways of viewing the universe.


Mostreligions and cultures include some kind of cosmology to explain the nature of the universe. In modern astronomy, the leading cosmology is still the Big Bang theory, which claims that the universe began with a huge explosion that sent mat ter and energy spreading outin all directions. One reason why fans watch Star Trek is for the various cosmologies depicted in the show, including different conceptions of space, time, and the meaning of life.
 
microcosm
    Something (such as a place or an event ) thatis seen as a small version of something much larger.


E.g.
 The large hippie communes of the 1960s and '70s were microcosms of socialist systems, with most of socialism's advantages and disadvantages.


A troubled urban school can look like a microcosm of America's educational system. A company's problems may be so typical that they can representan entire small country's economic woes "in microcosm." Microcosm, and especially it s synonym microcosmos, are also sometimes used when talking about the microscopic world. The documentary film Microcosmos is devoted to the remarkable insect life in an ordinary meadow on a single summer's day.
 
cosmopolitan
     (1)   Having   international   sophistication   and experience. (2) Made up of persons, element s, or influences from many different part s of the world.


E.g.
 New York, like most cosmopolitan cities, offers a wonderful array of restaurant s featuring foods from around the world.


Since cosmopolitan includes the root polit-, from the Greek word for "citizen", someone who is cosmopolitan is a "citizen of the world." She may be able to read the morning paper in Rio de Janeiro, at tend a lecture in Madrid, and assistata refugee camp in Uganda with equal ease- and maybe all in the same week. And a city or a country thatis cosmopolitan has aspect s and element s that come from various countries.
 
SCI comes from the Latin verb scire, "to know" or "to understand." The rootappears in such common words as science, which originally meant simply "knowledge," and conscience, meaning "moral knowledge." And to be conscious is to be in a state where you are able to know or understand.
 
conscientious
    (1) Governed by morality; scrupulous. (2) Resulting from painstaking or exactat tention.


E.g.
 New employees should be especially conscientious about turning in all their assignment s on time.


Conscience and it s adjective conscientious both come from a Latin verb meaning "to be aware of guilt ." Conscientious indicates extreme care, either in observing moral laws or in performing assigned duties. A conscientious person is someone with a strong moral sense, who has feelings of guilt when he or she violates it . A conscientious worker has a sense of duty that forces him or her to do a careful job. A conscientious report shows painstaking work on the part of the writer. And a conscientious objector is someone who, for reasons of conscience, refuses to fightin an army.
 
nescience                           Lack of knowledge or awareness: ignorance.


E.g.
 About once every class period, my political-science professor would angrily denounce the nescience of the American public.


This word, which means literally "non-knowledge," is only used by intellectuals, and the same is true of it s adjective, nescient. We all have heard the remarkable fact s: 40% of us believe thathumans and dinosaurs lived on earth at the same time; 49% believe that the President can ignore the Constit ution; 60% can't name the three branches of government ; 75% can't find Israel on a map; and so on. Is itany wonder we Americans are sometimes called nescient E.g.

 
prescient
Having or showing advance knowledge of whatis going to happen.


E.g.
 For years she had read the Wall Street Journal every morning, looking for prescient warnings about crashes, crises, and catastrophes on the horizon.


Being truly prescient would require supernatural powers. But well-informed people may have such good judgmentas to appear prescient , and prescientis often used to mean "having good foresight ." Some newspaper columnist s may seem prescientin their predictions, but we can'thelp suspecting thatany apparent prescience is usually the result of leaks from people with inside knowledge.
 
unconscionable
           (1) Not guided by any moral sense; unscrupulous.
(2) Shockingly excessive, unreasonable, or unfair.


E.g.
 When the fact s abouthow the cigaret te industry had lied aboutit s practices for decades finally came out , mostamericans found the behavior unconscionable.


Something that can't be done in good conscience is unconscionable, and such act s can range from betraying a confidence to mass  murder. For  a  five-syllable  word, unconscionable  is actually quite common. This is part ly because itisn'talways used very seriously; so, for example, a critic is free to call a fat new book "an unconscionable waste of trees." In law, an unconscionable contractis one that , even though it was signed by both parties, is so ridiculous thata judge will just throw it out .
 

 
JUNCT comes from the Latin verb jungere, meaning "to join." A junction is a place where roads or railways come t ogether. A conjunction is a word that joins two other words or groups of words: "this and that ," "to be or not to be."
 
juncture
(1) An important  point  in a process or activity. (2) A place where things join: junction.


E.g.
 The architect claims his design for the new Islamic Museum represent s a juncture of Muslim and Western culture.


The meaning of juncture can be entirely physical; thus, you can speak of the juncture of the turnpike and Route 116, or the juncture of the Shenandoah and Pot omac Rivers. Butit more often means something nonphysical. This may be a momentin time, especially a moment when importantevent s are "crossing" ("At this critical juncture, the President called t ogether his t op security advisers"). But juncture also often refers to the coming t ogether of two or more ideas, systems, styles, or fields ("These churches seem to operate at the juncture of religion and patriotism," "Her job is at the juncture of product design and marketing," et c.).
 
adjunct                      Something joined or added to another thing of which itis nota part .


E.g.
 All technical-school st udent s learn that classroom instruction can be a valuable adjunct to hands-on training.


With it s prefix, ad-, meaning "to or t oward," adjunctimplies that one thing is "joined t o" another. A car wash may be operated as an adjunct to a gas station. An adjunct professor is one who's at tached to the college without being a full member of the salaried faculty. And anyone trying to expand his or her vocabulary will find that daily reading of a newspaper is a worthwhile adjunct to actual vocabulary st udy.
 
disjunction
 A break, separation, or sharp difference bet ween two things.


E.g.
 By now she realized there was a serious disjunction bet ween the account s of his personal life thathis two best friends were giving her.


A disjunction may be a mere lack of connection bet ween two things, or a large gulf. There's often a huge disjunction bet ween what people expect from computers and what they know about them, and the disjunction bet ween a star's public image and her actual character may be justas big. We may speak of the disjunction bet ween science and morality, bet ween doing and telling, or bet ween knowing and explaining. In recentyears, disjunction seem to have been losing out to a newer synonym, the noun disconnect.
 
conjunct                          Bound t ogether; joined, united.


E.g.
 Politics and religion were conjunctin 18th-century England, and the American colonist s were intent on separating the t wo.


With it s prefix con-, meaning "with, t ogether," conjunct means basically "joined t ogether." A rather intellectual word, ithas special meanings in music (referring to a smooth melodic line that doesn't skip up or down) and astronomy (referring to two stars or planet s thatappear next to each other), butit s more general "bound t ogether" meaning is rarer. A conjunction is a word (particularly and, or, or but) that joins t ogether words or groups of words, and an adverb that joins two clauses or sentences (such as so, however, meanwhile, therefore, or also) is called a conjunctive adverb-or simply a conjunct.
 
PART, from the Latin word pars, meaning "part ," comes into English most obviously in our word part. An apartment or compartmentis part of a larger whole. The same is usually true of a particle.
 
bipartite                         (1) Being in two part s. (2) Shared by t wo.


E.g.
 The reportis a bipartite document , and all the important findings are in the second section.


Usually a technical word, bipartite is common in medicine and biology. A bipartite patella, for example, is a split kneecap; many people are born with them. Many creatures have a bipartite life cycle, living life in two very distinct forms. As one example, the velella begins life as a creature that travels with thousands of others in the form of a kind of sailboat , blown across the ocean's surface with the wind; only later does each velella turn into a tiny jellyfish.
 
impartial
  Fair and not biased; treating or affecting all equally.


E.g.
 Representatives of labor and managementagreed to have the  mat ter  decided  by  an impartial third party.


To be "partial t o" or "partial t oward" someone or something is to be somewhat biased or prejudiced, which means thata person who is partial really only sees part of the whole picture. To be impartial is the opposite. The United Nations sends impartial observers to monit or elections in troubled countries. We hope judges and juries will be impartial when they hand down verdict s. But grandparent s aren'texpected to be impartial when describing their new grandchild.
 
participle
     A word thatis formed from a verb but used like an adjective.


E.g.
 In the phrase "the crying child,""crying" is a present participle; in "satisfaction guaranteed," "guaranteed" is a past participle.


English verbs can take several basic forms, which we call their principal parts: the infinitive ("to move," "to speak," et c.), the past tense ("moved," "spoke"), the past participle ("moved," "spoken"), and the present  participle ("moving," "speaking"). The participles are words that "take part " in two different word classes: thatis, verb forms that can also act like adjectives ("the spoken word," "a moving experience"). A grammatical error called a dangling participle occurs when a sentence begins with a participle  that  doesn't  modify the  subject ; in  the sentence "Climbing the mountain, the cabin came in view," for example, "climbing" is a dangling participle since it doesn't modify "cabin."
 
partisan
 (1) A person who is strongly devoted to a particular cause or group.
(2) A guerrilla fighter.


E.g.
 Throughouthis career on the Supreme Court , he had been a forthright partisan of the cause of free speech.


A partisan is someone who support s one part or party. Sometimes the support takes the form of military action, as when guerrilla fighters take on government forces. But partisan is actually most often used as an adjective, usually referring to support of a political party. so if you're accused of being  t oo  partisan, or  of  practicing  partisan  politics, it  means  you're  mainly interested in boosting your own party and at tacking the other one.
 

 
MIS  comes  from  the  Latin  verb mittere,  "to  send."  A missile  is  something  sent  speeding through the air or water. And when your class is dismissed at the end of the day, you're senthome.
 
mission                        (1) A task that someone is given to do, especially a military task. (2) A task that someone considers an important duty.


E.g.
 She considers ither mission to prevent unwanted puppies and kit tens from being born.


Your own mission in life can be anything you pursue with almostreligious enthusiasm. People with a mission-whether it 's st opping drunk driving, keeping the t own's public areas clean, increasing local recycling, or building a community center-very often succeed in really changing things.
 
missionary                    A person undertaking a mission, and especially a religious missionary.


E.g.
 North American missionaries have been working in Central America for decades, and you can find their churches in even the mostremote jungle regions.


Beginning around 1540, an order of Catholic priest s known as the Jesuit s began to send it s members to many part s of the world to convert  peoples  who  believed  in  other gods to Christianity. Wherever they went , the Catholic missionaries built central buildings  for their religious work, and the buildings themselves became known as missions; many 17th-century missions in the American Westand Southwestare now preserved as museums. Their foes, the Protestant s, soon began sending out their  own missionaries, and t oday Protestant missionaries are probably far more numerous.
 
emissary
   Someone sent out to representanother; an agent .


E.g.
 Now in his 70s, he had served over many years as a presidential emissary to many troubled regions of the world .


Like missionaries, emissaries are sent on missions. However, emissaries are more likely to be representing government s, political leaders, and nonreligious instit utions, and an emissary's mission is usually to negotiate or to gather information. So a president may send a trusted emissary to a war-t orn region to discuss peace terms. A company's CEO may send an emissary to check outanother company that they may be thinking of buying. And a politician may send outan emissary to persuade a wealthy individual to become a supporter.
 
transmission
    (1) The act  or process of sending something from one point to another, especially sending electrical signals to a radio, television, computer, et c. (2) The gears by which the power is passed from the engine to the axle in a mot or vehicle.


E.g.
 Even in the Middle Ages, transmission of news of a ruler's death across the Asian continent could be accomplished by sun reflect ors within 24 hours.


Since trans- means "across" (see TRANS), it 's nothard to see the meaning of transmission. Disease transmission occurs when an infection passes from one living thing to another. TV signal transmission can be interrupted by tree leaves, including moving leaves and branches during a st orm. Your car's transmission transmits the engine's power to the axle, changing the gears to keep the engine working with maximum efficiency at various speeds.
 
PEL comes from the Latin verb pellere, meaning "to move or drive." So a propeller moves a small airplane forward. And if you dispel someone's fears, you "drive them away."
 
compel              (1) To  force  (someone) to do  something. (2) To  make  (something) happen.


E.g.
 After returning from the lecture, they felt compelled to contribute to one of the refugee relief agencies.


The prefix com- act s as a strengthener in this word; thus, to compel is to drive powerfully, or force. So you may feel compelled to speak to a friend abouthis drinking, or compelled to reveal a secretin order to prevent something from happening. A compulsion is usually a powerful inner urge; a compulsive shopper or a compulsive gambler usually can'thold onto money for long. You might not want to do something unless there's a compelling reason; however, a compelling film is simply one that seems serious and important .
 
expel                    (1) To drive or force out . (2) To force to leave, usually by official action.


E.g.
 For repeatedly ignoring importantagreement s over several years, the two countries were eventually expelled from the trade organization.


To expel is to drive out , and it s usual noun is expulsion. Expel is similar to eject, butexpel suggest s pushing out while eject suggest s throwing out . Also, ejecting may only be temporary: the player ejected from a game may be back t omorrow, but the st udentexpelled from school is probably out forever.
 
impel                   To urge or drive forward by strong moral force.


E.g.
 As the meeting wore on withoutany real progress being made, she feltimpelled to stand and speak.


Impel is very similar in meaning to compel, and often a perfect synonym, though it tends to suggesteven more strongly an inner drive to do something and a greater urgency to act , especially for moral reasons. But when impel takes it s noun and adjective forms, itchanges slight ly. So an impulse-such as "impulse buying," when you suddenly see something cool and know you've got to have it -often isn't based on anything very serious. And impulsive behavior in general, such as blurting out something st upid on the spur of the moment , is the kind of thing you're supposed to get over when you grow up.
 
repel                (1) To keep (something) out or away. (2) To drive back.


E.g.
 Her son, knowing how she was repelled by rat s and snakes, had started keeping them in his bedroom.


Since re- can mean not just "again" butalso "back" (see RE-), repel means "drive back." Repel has two common adjective forms; thus, a repellent or repulsive odor may drive us into the other room. It s main noun form is repulsion. Magnet s exhibit both at traction and repulsion, and the goal of an armed defense is the repulsion of an enemy; but we generally use repulsion to mean "strong dislike." In recentyears, repulse has been increasingly used as a synonym for repel ("That guy repulses me").
 

 
Words from Mythology

arachnid                        A member of the class Arachnida, which principally includes animals with four pairs of legs and no antennae, such as spiders, scorpions, mites, and ticks.


E.g.
 His interestin arachnids began when, as a child, he would watch spiders build their gorgeous webs in the corners of the porch.


The Greek word for "spider" is arachne, and, according to Greek mythology, the original arachnid was a girl named Arachne. A marvelous weaver, she made the mistake of claiming she was bet ter ather craft than the goddess Athena. In a contest bet ween the t wo, she angered the goddess by weaving a remarkable tapestry showing the gods behaving badly. As punishment , Athena changed Arachne into a spider, fated to spend her life weaving. With their eight legs, arachnids are easily distinguished from the six-legged insect s, on which they feed by injecting digesting juices and then sucking up the liquefied remains.
 
calliope                        A musical instrument similar to an organ in which whist les are sounded by steam or compressed air.


E.g.
 The t own's old calliope, with it s unmistakable sound, summoned them to the fair every summer.


To the ancient Greeks, the Muses were nine goddesses, each of whom was the spirit of one or more of the art s and sciences. Calliope was the Muse of heroic or epic poetry, who inspired poet s to write such epics as the Iliad and the Odyssey. Since the lengthy epics were generally sung from beginning to end, she was responsible for a great deal of musical reciting. But she wouldn't necessarily have approved  of  having  her  name  used  for  the  hooting  organlike instrument that was invented in America around 1855. Calliopes gave a festive air to the great showboat s that floated up and down the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers giving theatrical performances; the loudest could supposedly be heard eight miles away, at tracting cust omers from all around. Today they are most ly heard on merry-go-rounds and at circuses.
 
dryad                  A wood nymph.


E.g.
 The ancient Greeks' love of trees can be seen in their belief thatevery tree contained a dryad, which died when the tree was cut .


The term dryad comes from the Greek word for "oak tree." As the Greeks saw it , every tree (not only oaks) had a spirit . The best known of the dryads was Daphne. The beautiful daughter of a river god, she was desired by the god Apollo; as he was about to capture her, she prayed to her father to save her, and he transformed her into a laurel tree. In her honor, Apollo commanded that the poet who won the highest prize every year be crowned with a laurel wreath. The Greeks' respect for trees  unfort unately failed to keep Greece's  forest s from shrinking great ly over the centuries, and those thatremain produce lit t le wood of good quality.
 
fauna Animal life, especially  the  animals  that  live  naturally  in  a  given  area  or environment .


E.g.
 The larger fauna of the county include coyotes, black bear, deer, moose, wild turkey, hawks, and vultures.


Faunus and Fauna were the Roman woodland god and goddess for whom animals were a particular concern. Faunus was the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Pan, and like Pan, he had goat s' legs. Their goat -legged helpers, called fauns, were known for their love of pleasure and mischief. The fauna of a continentare often very similar across a broad east -west band; from north to south, however, they may vary great ly.
 
flora Plant life, especially the flowering plant s that live naturally in a specific area or environment .


E.g.
 Scientist s are busily identifying the flora of the Amazon rain forest before the rapid expansion of commercial interest s consumes it .


Flora means "flower" in Latin, and Flora was the Roman goddess of spring and flowering plant s, especially wildflowers and plant s notraised for food. She was shown as a beautiful young woman in a long, flowing dress with flowers in her hair, strewing flowers over the earth. English preserves her name in such words as floral, floret, and flourish. A region's flora may range from  tiny violet s to t owering trees. The common phrase "flora and fauna" covers justaboutevery visible living thing.
 
herculean
 (1) Extremely  strong. (2) Extremely  extensive, intense, or difficult .


E.g.
 Accomplishing all the things he promised during the presidential campaign will be a herculean task.


The hero Hercules, son of the god Zeus by a human mother, was famous for his superhuman strength. To pacify the wrath of the god Apollo, he was forced to perform t welve enormously difficult tasks, or "labors." These ranged from descending into the underworld to bring back the terrifying dog that guarded it s entrance to destroying the many-headed monster called the Hydra. Any job or task that 's extremely difficult or calls for enormous strength is therefore called herculean.
 
Pandora's box
        A source of many troubles.


E.g.
 In a thundering speech, he predicted that , if the bill was passed, the new policy would open a Pandora's box of economic problems.


The god Prometheus st ole fire from  heaven to give to the  human  race, which  originally consisted only of men. To punish humanity, the other gods created the first woman, the beautiful Pandora. As a gift , Zeus gave her a box, which she was t old never to open. However, as soon as he was out of sight she t ook off the lid, and out swarmed all the troubles of the world, never to be recaptured. Only Hope was leftin the box, st uck under the lid. Anything that looks ordinary but may produce unpredictable harmful result s can thus be called a Pandora's box.
 
Scylla and Charybdis
              Two equally dangerous alternatives.


E.g.
 Doct ors and patient s who need to calculate the ideal dosage of the medication, knowing how it can trigger a different dangerous condition, often feel caught bet ween Scylla and Charybdis.


The Strait of Messina is the narrow passage bet ween the island of Sicily and the "t oe" of Italy's "boot ." In Greek mythology, two monsters hovered on either side of the strait . Scylla, a female monster with six snake-like heads, each with pointed teeth, barked like a dog from the rocks on the Italian side. Charybdis, on the Sicilian side, caused a whirlpool by swallowing the waters of the sea three times a day. When Odysseus at tempted to sail bet ween them, he encountered disaster on both sides. Being caught bet ween Scylla and Charybdis is a lot like being bet ween a rock and a hard place.

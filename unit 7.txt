VIS comes from a Latin verb meaning "see." Vision is whatenables us to see, visual images are visible to our eyes, and a visitor is someone who comes to see something. The same verb actually gives us another root , vid-, as in Julius Caesar's famous statementabouthis military exploit s, "Veni, vidi, vici" ("I came, I saw, I conquered"), and such common English words as video.
 
vista                  (1) A distant view. (2) An extensive mental view, as over a stretch of time.


E.g.
 The economic vista for the next two years looks excellent , according to a poll of business economist s.


Vista is generally used t oday for broad sweeping views of the kind you might see from a mountaint op. But the word originally meantan avenue-like view, narrowed by a line of trees on either side. And vista has also long been used (like view and outlook) to mean a mental scan of the future-as if you were riding down a long grand avenue and whatyou could see a mile or so ahead of you was where you'd be in the very near future.
 
vis-ид-vis                          In relation to or compared with.


E.g.
 Many financial reporters worry about the loss of U.S. economic strength vis-ид-vis our principal trading part ners.


Vis-ид-vis comes from Latin by way of French, where it means literally "face-t o-face." In English it was first used to mean a lit t le horse-drawn carriage in which two people sat opposite each other. From there itacquired various other meanings, such as "dancing part ner." Today it no longer refers to actual physical faces and bodies, butit s modern meaning comes from the fact that things thatare face-t o-face can easily be compared or contrasted. So, for example, a greyhound is very tall vis-ид-vis a Scot tie, and the Red Sox have often fared badly vis-ид-vis the Yankees.
 
visionary                          (1) A person  with  foresight  and  imagination. (2) A dreamer whose ideas are often impractical.


E.g.
 His followers regarded him as an inspired visionary; his opponent s saw him as either a con man or a lunatic.


A visionary is someone with a strong vision of the future. Since such visions aren'talways accurate, a visionary's ideas may either work brilliant ly or fail miserably. Even so, visionary is usually a positive word. Martin Luther King, Jr., for instance, was a visionary in his hopes and ideas for a just society. The word is also an adjective; thus, for example, we may speak of a visionary project , a visionary leader, a visionary painter, or a visionary company.
 
envisage                     To have a mental picture of; visualize.


E.g.
 A mere three weeks after they had started dating, the two were already arguing, and none of us could envisage the relationship lasting for long.


One of the imagination's most valuable uses is it s ability to see something in the "mind's eye"-thatis, to visualize, envision, or envisage something. Envisaging a possibility may be one of the chief abilities that separate human beings from  the other animals. What we envisage may be physical (such as a completed piece of furniture) or nonphysical (such as finishing college). Envisaging life with a puppy might lead us down to the pound to buy one, and envisaging the sinking of an island nation may focus our minds on climate change.
 
SPECT comes from the Latin verb specere, meaning "to look at ," and produces several familiar English words. Spectacles can be glasses thatyou look through; buta spectacle can also be a remarkable sight -in Roman times, perhaps a spectacular chariotrace or a spectacularly bloody bat t le bet ween gladiat ors and wild beast s, mounted for the pleasure of it s spectators.
 
aspect                   (1) A part of something. (2) A certain way in which something appears or may be regarded.


E.g.
 Many expert s believe the mental aspect of distance racing is more important than the physical aspect .


Since aspectus in Latin means "looked at ," an aspect of something is basically the direction from which it 's looked at . So we may say that travel is your favorite aspect of your job, or thateating well is one aspect of a healthy life. If you look ata stage set from the front , it looks completely different than from behind, where all the mechanisms are visible, and both aspect s are important . The word can be very useful when you're analyzing something, and it 's used a great deal in the writings of scholars.
 
prospect                     (1) The possibility that something will happen in the future. (2) An opport unity for something to happen.


E.g.
 There was lit t le prospect of a breakthrough in the negotiations before the elections.


Since the Latin prefix pro- often means "forward" (see PRO), prospectrefers to looking forward. The prospect of a recession may lead invest ors to pull their money out of the st ock market . Graduates of a good law school usually have excellent prospect s for finding employment . Prospective st udent s roam campuses with their parent s in the year before they plan to enter college.
 
perspective
    (1) Point of view; the angle, direction, or standpoint from which a person looks at something. (2) The art or technique of painting or drawing a scene so that object s in it seem to have depth and distance.


E.g.
 From the perspective of the lowly soldier, the war looked very different .


To the modern mind, it 's hard to believe that perspective had to be "discovered," but before the 1400s paintings simply lacked accurate perspective. Instead, important people and object s were simply shown larger than less important ones; and although  distant  object s  were sometimes shown smaller than near ones, this wasn't done in a regular and accurate way. Justas odd, many paintings didn'trepresent the other meaning of perspective either-thatis, a scene might not be shown as if it were being seen from one single place. Today, perspective is used much like standpoint. Justas standpoint once used to mean simply the physical place where you stand but t oday also means the way you "see" things as a result of who you are and whatyou do, the same could be said about perspective.
 
prospect us
   A printed statement  that  describes something (such as a new business or a st ock offering) and is sent out to people who may be interested in buying or investing.


E.g.
 The prospect us for the mutual fund says nothing abouthow it s profit forecast s  were calculated.


Like prospect, prospectus looks forward. Thus, a prospect us originally out lined something that didn'tyetexist , describing  whatit  would  become. This might  even  be a  book; the  great dictionary of Noah Webster, like that of Samuel Johnson, was firstannounced in the form of a prospect us, so that well-t o-do people mightactually subscribe to it -thatis, pay for itin advance so that Webster would have money to live on while writing it . Soon, prospectus was being used to mean a description of a private school or college, intended to at tract new st udent s. Today the word very often means a description of a st ock offering or mutual fund, whether new or not .
 

 
VOC comes from the Latin words meaning "voice" and "speak." So a vocal ensemble is a singing group. A vocation was originally a "calling" from God to do religious work as a priest , monk, or nun, though t oday most people use the word just to mean a career. And a vocabulary is a set of words for speaking.
 
equivocate
    (1) To use ambiguous language, especially in order to deceive.
(2) To avoid giving a directanswer.


E.g.
 As the company direct ors continued to equivocate, the union prepared to return to the picket lines.


With it s rootequi-, meaning "equal," equivocate suggest s speaking on both sides of an issue at the same time. An equivocal answer is one that manages not to take a stand; an unequivocal answer, by contrast , is strong and clear. Politicians are famous for equivocating, butequivocation is also typical of used-car salesmen, nervous wit nesses in a courtroom, and guys whose girlfriends ask them how commit ted they are to a relationship.
 
irrevocable
Impossible to call back or retract .


E.g.
 She had t old him she wasn't going to see him again, buthe couldn't believe her decision was irrevocable.


Irrevocable has a formal sound to itand is often used in legal context s. Irrevocable trust s are trust funds that cannot be dissolved by the people who created them (the other kind is a revocable trust ). An irrevocable creditis an absolute obligation from a bank to provide credit to a cust omer. Irrevocable gift s, under U.S. tax law, are gift s thatare given by one living person to another and can't be reclaimed by the giver. But the word isn'talways legal; we've all had to make irrevocable decisions, decisions that commit us absolutely to something.
 
advocate
To speak in favor of.


E.g.
 Our lawyer is advocating a suitagainst the state, but most of us would rather try some other approaches first .


The verb advocate may be followed by for ("advocated for bet ter roads," "advocated for merging the two school district s") or by a noun or gerund ("advocating an increase in the military budget ," "advocated closing the budget gap"). Butadvocate isn't only a verb: An advocate is someone who advocates for you, or argues on your side. Originally, this was often a lawyer in court , and in Britain advocate is still a term for "lawyer."
 
vociferous Making noisy or emphatic out cries.


E.g.
 Whenever the referee at these soccer games makes a questionable call, you hear vociferous protest s from half the parent s.


A vociferous group shout s loudly and insistent ly, and they're usually not  t oo happy about something. So, for  example, we  often  hear  about  vociferous  critics, vociferous  demands, vociferous opponent s, or a vociferous minority. When a small group makes it self vociferous enough, everyone else may even start thinking it 's actually a majority.
 
PHON is a Greek root meaning "sound," "voice," or "speech." It 's probably most familiar in the form of the English suffix -phone, in words that begin with a Greek or Latin rootas well. Thus, th e tele- in telephone means "far," the micro- in microphone means "small," the xylo- in xylophone means "wood," and so on.
 
phonics                    A method of teaching beginners to read and pronounce words by learning the characteristic sounds of let ters, let ter groups, and especially syllables.


E.g.
 My son's school switched to phonics instruction several years ago, and reading achievementin the early grades has been improving.


In the field of beginning reading, there are two basic schools of thoughtin the U.S. t oday. One emphasizes "whole language" teaching, which relies on teaching a lot of reading; the other emphasizes phonics, teaching how let ters  and  syllables  correspond to sounds.  Phonics instruction may be especially difficultin English, since English has the most difficult spelling of any Western language. Consider the various ways we create the f sound in cough, photo, and giraffe, or the sh sound in special, issue, vicious, and portion, or the k sound in tack, quite, and shellac, and how we pronounce the o in do, core, lock, and bone, or the ea in lead, ocean, idea, and early. Teaching phonics obviously isn'tan easy job, butit 's probably an important one.
 
phonetic                        Relating to or representing the sounds of the spoken language.


E.g.
 In almostevery Spanish word the pronunciation is clear from the spelling, so the phonetic part of learning Spanish isn't usually a big challenge.


The English alphabetis phonetic-thatis, the let ters represent sounds. The Chinese alphabet , however, isn't phonetic, since it s symbols representideas rather than sounds. Buteven in English, a let ter doesn'talways represent the same sound; the "a" in cat, father, and mate, for example, represent s three different sounds. Because of this, books about words often use specially created phonetic alphabet s in which each symbol stands for a single sound in order to represent pronunciations. So in this book, cat, father, and mate would be phonetically represented as           ,                  , and             .
 
polyphonic                          Referring to a style of music in which two or more melodies are sung or played againsteach other in harmony.


E.g.
 Whenever he needed something calming, he would put on some quiet polyphonic music from the Renaissance and just let the voices waft over him.


Since poly- means "many" (see POLY), polyphonic music has "many voices." In polyphony, each parthas it s own melody, and they weave t ogether in a web that may become very dense; a famous piece by Thomas Tallis, composed around 1570, has 40 separate voice part s. Polyphony reached it s height during the 16th century with Italian madrigals and the sacred music of such composers as Tallis, Palestrina, and Byrd. Usually when we speak of polyphony we're talking about music of Bach's time and earlier; but the principles remain the same t oday, and songwriters such as the Beat les have sometimes used polyphony as well.
 
cacophony
   Harsh or unpleasant sound.


E.g.
 In New York she was often dragged off by her boyfriend to downt own jazz concert s, where she struggled to make sense of what sounded like nothing but cacophony.


Cacophony employs the Greek prefix caco-, meaning "bad," but noteverything we call cacophonous is necessarily bad. Grunge, thrash, hardcore, and goth music are unlistenable to some people and very popular to others. Open-air food market s may be marked by a cacophony of voices butalso by wonderful sight s and sounds. On the other hand, few people can really enjoy, for more than a few minutes, the cacophony of jackhammers, car horns, and truck engines thatassault s the city pedestrian on a hot day in August .
 

 
CUR, from the Latin verb curare, means basically "care for." Our verb cure comes from this root , as do manicure ("care of the hands") and pedicure ("care of the feet ").
 
curative                          Having to do with curing diseases.


E.g.
 As soon as the antibiotic entered his system, he imagined he could begin to feel it s curative effect s.


Medical researchers are finding curative substances in places that surprise them. Folklore has led to some "new" cures of old diseases, and natural substances never before tried have often proved effective. Quinine, which comes from a tree in the Andes, was the original drug for malaria; aspirin's main ingredient came from willow bark; and Taxol, a drug used in treating several cancers, was originally extracted from the bark of a yew tree. The curative properties of these natural drugs are t oday duplicated in the laborat ory.
 
curat or                           Someone in charge of something where things are on exhibit , such as a collection, a museum, or a zoo.


E.g.
 In recent decades, zoo curat ors have tried to make the animals' surroundings more and more like their natural homes.


In a good-sized art museum, each curat or is generally responsible for a single depart ment or collection: European painting, Asian sculpture, Native American art , and so on. Curatorial duties include acquiring new art works, caring for and repairing object s already owned, discovering frauds and counterfeit s, lending art works to other museums, and mounting exhibitions of everything from Greek sculpture to 20th-century clothing.
 
procure                        To get possession of; obtain.


E.g.
 Investigat ors were looking into the question of how the governor had procured such a huge loan at such a favorable rate.


While procure has the general meaning of "obtain," it usually implies that some effortis required. It may also suggest get ting something through a formal set of procedures. In many business offices, a particular person is responsible for procuring supplies, and governmentagencies have formal procurement policies. When teenagers use an older friend to procure the wrong kind of supplies for their parties, they often risk get ting into trouble.
 
sinecure                   A job or position requiring lit t le work but  usually providing some income.


E.g.
 The job of Dean of St udent s atany college is no sinecure; the hours can be long and the work draining.


Sinecure contains the Latin word sine, "without ," and thus means "without care." In some countries, the governmentin power may be free to award sinecure positions to their valued supporters; in other countries, this would be regarded as corruption. The positions occupied by British royalty are called sinecures by some people, who claim they enjoy their enormous wealth in return for nothing atall. But their many supporters point to the amount of public- service, charitable, and ceremonial work they perform, not to mention the effort they putinto promoting Britain to the world.
 
PERI, in both Latin and Greek, means "around." A period is often a span of time that keeps coming around regularly, day after day or year after year. With a periscope, you can see around corners. Peristalsis is the process that moves food around the intestines; withoutit , digestion would grind to a halt .
 
perimeter
    The boundary or distance around a body or figure.


E.g.
 In a medieval siege, an army would surround the perimeter of a city's high walls, denying the population any food from out side as itassaulted the walls with catapult s and bat tering rams.


The perimeter of a prison is ringed with high walls and watcht owers, and the entire perimeter of Australia is bounded by water. In geometry, you may be asked to calculate the perimeter of various geometrical shapes. In basket ball, the perimeter is the area beyond the free-throw circle; a "perimeter player" tends to stay out side that circle. Try not to confuse this word with parameter, which usually means a rule or limit that controls what something is or how it can be done.
 
periodontal
     Concerning or affecting the tissues around the teeth.


E.g.
 Years of bad living had filled his teeth with cavities, butit was periodontal disease that finished them off.


In dentistry, cavities are important but they aren't the whole st ory; whathappens to your gums is every bitas vital to your dental health. When you don't floss regularly to keep plaque from forming on your teeth and gums, the gums will slowly deteriorate. Dentist s called periodontists specialize in the treat ment of periodontal problems, and when the gums have broken down to the point where they can'thold the teeth in place a periodontist may need to provide dental implant s, a cost ly and unpleasant process. Buteven a periodontist can't keep your gums healthy; that job is up to you.
 
peripatetic (1) Having to do with walking. (2) Moving or traveling from place to place.


E.g.
 She spenther early adultyears as a peripatetic musician, traveling from one engagement to another.


The philosopher Arist ot le had his school at the Lyceum gymnasium in Athens. The Lyceum may have resembled the Parthenon in being surrounded by a row of columns, or colonnade, which the Greeks would have called a peripatoi. Arist ot le was also said to have paced slowly while teaching, and the Greek word for "pacing" was peripatos. And finally, peripatos meant simply "discussion."  Whatever the source of  the word, Arist ot le and his followers became known  as  the Peripatetics, and  the  "pacing"  sense  led to peripatetic's English meaning of traveling or moving about . Johnny Appleseed is a good example of a peripatetic soul, and peripatetic executives and salespeople t oday stare into their lapt op computers while endlessly flying from city to city.
 
peripheral                     (1) Having to do with the outer edges, especially of the field of vision. (2) Secondary or supplemental.


E.g.
 Like most good fourth-grade teachers, he had excellent peripheral vision, and the kids were convinced thathe had eyes in the back of his head.


Your peripheral vision is the outer area of your field of vision, where you can still detect movementand shapes. It can be very valuable when, for instance, you're driving into Chicago atrush hour, especially when switching  lanes. When people  call an  issue  in a  discussion peripheral, they mean thatit 's not of primary importance, and they're probably suggesting thateveryone get back to the main t opic. Peripheral is now also a noun: computer peripherals are the added component s-printers, webcams, microphones, et c.-thatincrease a computer's capacities.
 

 
SENS comes from the Latin noun sensus, meaning "feeling" or "sense." Sense it self obviously comes straight from the Latin. A sensation is something you sense. And if you're sensitive, you feel or sense things sharply, maybe even t oo sharply.
 
sensor                  A device that detect s a physical quantity (such as a movement or a beam of light ) and responds by transmit ting a signal.


E.g.
 The out door light s are triggered by a motion sensor that detect s changes in infrared energy given off by moving human bodies.


Sensors are used t oday almosteverywhere. Radar guns bounce microwaves off moving cars. A burglar alarm may use a phot osensor to detect when a beam of lighthas been broken, or may use ultrasonic sound waves that bounce off moving object s. Still other sensors may detect pressure (barometers) or chemicals (Breathalyzers and smoke detect ors). St ud finders, used by carpenters to locate wooden st uds under a wall, may employ magnet s or radar. Wired gloves, which relay information about the position of the fingers, are used in virtual-reality environment s. A cheap car alarm may be nothing buta shock sensor, in which a strong vibration will cause two metal surfaces to come t ogether.
 
desensitize
 To cause (someone or something) to react less to or be less affected by something.


E.g.
 Even squeamish nursing st udent s report becoming desensitized to the sight of blood after a few months of training.


Physical desensitizing is something that biologist s have long been aware of. Basic training in the armed forces tries to desensitize new recruit s to pain. We can desensitize ourselves to the summer heat by turning off the air conditioning, or become desensitized to the cold by walking barefootin the snow. But desensitize is more  often  used  when  talking  about  negative emotions. Parent s worry that their children will be desensitized to violence by playing video games. Soldiers may become desensitized to death on the bat t lefield. Desensitizing may be natural and desirable under some circumstances, but maybe not so good in others.
 
extrasensory
   Not  acting  or occurring  through  any  of  the  known senses.


E.g.
 A kind of extrasensory capacity seems to tell some soldiers when danger is near.


Since extra means "out side, beyond" (see EXTRA), extrasensory means basically "beyond the senses." Extrasensory perception, or ESP, usually includes communication bet ween minds involving no obvious contact  (telepathy), gaining information about  something without  using the normal senses (clairvoyance), or predicting the future (precognition). According to polls, about  40% of Americans believe in ESP, and many of them have had personal experiences  that seem to prove it s existence. When someone jumps into your mind months or years after you had last thought of him or her, and the next day you learn that the person has just died, it can be hard to convince yourself it was just coincidence. Still, scientific at tempt s to prove the existence of ESP have never been terribly successful.
 
sensuous
      (1) Highly pleasing to the senses. (2) Relating to the senses.


E.g.
 Part of whataudiences loved abouther was the delight she t ook in the sensuous pleasures of well-prepared food.


Sensuous and sensual are close in meaning but notidentical, and sensuous was actually coined by the poet John Milt on so thathe wouldn'thave to use sensual. Sensuous usually implies pleasing of the senses by art or similar means; great music, for example, can be a source of sensuous delight . Sensual, on the other hand, usually describes gratification of the senses or physical appetites as an end in it self; thus we often think (perhaps unfairly) of wealthy Romans leading lives devoted to sensual pleasure. You can see why the Puritan Milt on mighthave wanted another word.
 
SOPH come from the Greek words meaning "wise" and  "wisdom."  In  English  the  root sometimes appears in words where the wisdom is of the "wise guy" variety, butin words such as philosophy we see it used more respect fully.
 
sophistry                           Cleverly deceptive reasoning or argument .


E.g.
 For lawyers and politicians, the practice of sophistry from time to time is almost unavoidable.


The Sophist s were a group of Greek teachers of rhet oric and philosophy, famous during the 5th century B.C., who moved from t own to t own offering their teaching for a fee. The Sophist s originally represented a respectable school of philosophy, but some critics claimed that they tried to persuade by means of clever but misleading argument s. The philosopher Plato wrote negatively about  them, and the comic dramatistarist ophanes made fun of them, showing them making ridiculously fine distinctions about word meanings. We get our modern meanings of sophist, sophistry, and the adjective sophistical most ly from the opinions of these two men.
 
sophisticated
      (1)  Having  a  thorough  knowledge  of  the  ways  of society. (2) Highly complex or developed.


E.g.
 In Woman of the Year, Katharine Hepburn plays a sophisticated journalist who can handle everything except Spencer Tracy.


A sophisticated argumentis thorough and well-worked-out . A satellite is a sophisticated piece of technology, complex and designed to accomplish difficult tasks. A sophisticated person, such as Humphrey Bogartin Casablanca, knows how to getaround in the world. But sophistication isn'talways admired. As you might guess, the word is closely related to sophistry (see above), and it s original meanings weren't very positive, and still t oday many of us aren't sure we really like sophisticates.
 
sophomoric                Overly impressed  with  one's own  knowledge, but  in  fact undereducated and immature.


E.g.
 We can'teven listen to those sophomoric songs of his, with their at tempt s at profound wisdom that just demonstrate how lit t le he knows about life.


Sophomoric seems to include the root s soph-, "wise," and moros, "fool" (seen in words such as moron), so the contrast bet ween wisdom and ignorance is builtrightinto the word. Cambridge University introduced the term sophomore for it s second-year st udent s in the 17th century (though it 's no longer used in Britain), maybe to suggest thata sophomore has delusions of wisdom since he's no longer an ignorant freshman. In America t oday, sophomore is ambiguous since it can refer to either high school or college. But sophomoric should properly describe something-wit , behavior, argument s, et c.-thatis at least trying to be sophisticated.
 
theosophy                     A set of teachings about God and the world based on mystical insight , especially teachings founded on a blend of Buddhistand Hindu beliefs.


E.g.
 He had experimented with a number of faiths, starting with Buddhism and ending with a mixture of Eastern and Western thought that could best be called theosophy.


The word theosophy, combining root s meaning "God" and "wisdom," appeared back in the 17th century, but the well-known religious movement by that name, under the leadership of the Russian Helena Blavat sky, appeared only around 1875. Blavat sky's theosophy combined element s of Plat o's philosophy with Christian, Buddhist , and Hindu thought (including reincarnation), in a way that she claimed had been divinely revealed to her. The Theosophical Society, founded in 1875 to promote her beliefs, still exist s, as does the Anthroposophical Society, founded by her follower Rudolf Steiner.
 

 
Words from Mythology and History

Achilles' heel
  A vulnerable point .


E.g.
 By now his rival for the Senate seathad discovered his Achilles' heel, the courtrecords of the terrible divorce he had gone through ten years earlier.


When the hero Achilles was an infant , his sea-nymph mother dipped him into the river Styx to make him immortal. But since she held him by one heel, this spot did not t ouch the water and so remained mortal and vulnerable, and it was here thatachilles was eventually mortally wounded. Today, the tendon that stretches up the calf from the heel is called the Achilles tendon. But the term Achilles' heel isn't used in medicine; instead, it 's only used with the general meaning "weak point "-for instance, to refer to a section of a country's borders thataren't militarily protected, or to a Jeopardy contestant 's ignorance in the Sport s category.
 
arcadia
 A region or set ting of rural pleasure and peacefulness.


E.g.
 The Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania are a vacationer's arcadia.


Arcadia, a beautiful rural area in Greece, became the favorite set ting for poems aboutideal innocence unaffected by the passions of the larger world, beginning with the works of the Roman poet Virgil. There, shepherds play their  pipes and sigh with longing for flirtatious nymphs; shepherdesses sing to their flocks; and goat -footed nature gods play in the fields and woods. Today, city dwellers who hope to retire to a country house often indulge in arcadian fantasies about whatrural life will be like.
 
Cassandra
  A person who predict s misfort une or disaster.


E.g.
 They used to call him a Cassandra because he often expected the worst , buthis predictions tended to come true.


Cassandra, the daughter of King Priam of Troy, was one of those beautiful young maidens with whom Apollo fell in love. He gave her the gift of prophecy in return for the promise of her sexual favors, but  at the last minute she refused him. Though he could not take back his gift , he angrily pronounced that no one would ever believe her predictions; so when she prophesied the fall of her city to the Greeks and the death of it s heroes, she was laughed at by the Trojans. A modern-day Cassandra goes around predicting gloom and doom-and may turn out to be right some of the time.
 
cyclopean
    Huge or massive.


E.g.
 They're imagining a new medical center on a cyclopean scale-a vast ten-block campus with thirty high-rise buildings.


The Cyclopes of Greek mythology were huge, crude giant s, each with a single eye in the middle of his forehead. Odysseus and his men had a terrible encounter with a Cyclops, and escaped ut ter disaster only by stabbing a burning stick into the monster's eye. The great st one walls at such ancient  sites as Troy and Mycenae are called cyclopean because the st ones are so massive and the construction (which uses no cement ) is so expert thatit was assumed that only a superhuman race such as the Cyclopes could have achieved such a feat .
 
draconian
      Extremely severe or cruel.


E.g.
 The severe punishment s carried outin Saudi Arabia, including flogging for drunkenness, hand amputation for robbery, and beheading for drug trafficking, strike most of the world as draconian.


Draconian comes from the name of Draco, a leader of Athens in the 7th century B.C. who in 621 B.C. produced it s first legal code. The punishment s he prescribed were extraordinarily harsh; almostanyone who couldn't pay his debt s became a slave, and even minor crimes were punishable by death. So severe were these penalties thatit was said that the code was writ ten in blood. In the next century, the wise leader Solon would revise all of Draco's code, retaining the death penalty only for the crime of murder.
 
myrmidon A   loyal   follower,  especially one who executes orders unquestioningly.


E.g.
 To an American, these soldiers were like myrmidons, all t oo eager to do the Beloved Leader's bidding.


In the Trojan War, the troops of the greathero Achilles were called Myrmidons. As bloodthirsty as wolves, they were the fiercest fighters in all Greece. They were said to have come from the island of Aegina, where, after the island's entire population had been killed by a plague, it was said to have been repopulated by Zeus, by turning all the ant s in a great  anthill into men. Because of their insect origin, the Myrmidons were blindly loyal to Achilles, so loyal that they would die withoutresisting if ordered t o. The Trojans would not be the last fighting force to believe thata terrifying opposing army was made up of men who were not quite human.
 
nemesis
  A powerful, frightening opponent or rival who is usually vict orious.


E.g.
 During the 1970s and '80s, Japanese carmakers became the nemesis of the U.S. auto industry.


The Greek goddess Nemesis doled outrewards for noble act s and vengeance for evil ones, butit 's only her vengeance thatanyone remembers. According to the Greeks, Nemesis did notalways punish an offender rightaway, but might waitas much as five generations to avenge a crime. Regardless, her cause was always justand her eventual vict ory was sure. But t oday a nemesis doesn'talways dispense justice; a powerful drug lord may be the nemesis of  a Mexican police chief, for instance, justas Ernst Stavro Blofeld was James Bond's nemesis in three of Ian Fleming's novels.
 
Trojan horse                       Someone or something that works from within to weaken or defeat .


E.g.
 Researchers are working on a kind of Trojan horse that will be welcomed into the diseased cells and then destroy them from within.


After besieging the walls of Troy for ten years, the Greeks builta huge, hollow wooden horse, secret ly filled it with armed warriors, and presented it to the Trojans as a gift for the goddess Athena, and the Trojans t ook the horse inside the city's walls. That night , the armed Greeks swarmed outand captured and burned the city. A Trojan horse is thus anything that looks innocent but , once accepted, has power to harm or destroy-for example, a computer program that seems helpful butends up corrupting or demolishing the computer's soft ware.

TERM/TERMIN comes from the Latin verb terminare, "to limit , bound, or set limit s t o," and the noun terminus, "limit or boundary." In English, those boundaries or limit s tend to be final. A term goes on for a given amount of time and then ends, and to terminate a sentence or a meeting or a ballgame means to end it .
 
terminal
(1) Forming or relating to an end or limit . (2) Fatal.


E.g.
 She knows she's in the late stages of a terminal illness, and has already drawn up a will.


A terminal disease ends in death. If you're terminally bored, you're "bored to death." For many st udent s, a high-school diploma is their terminal degree (others finish college before terminating their education). A bus or train terminal is the endpoint  of the line. A computer terminal was originally the endpoint of a line connecting to a central computer. A terminal ornament may mark the end of a building, and terminal punctuation ends this sentence.
 
indeterminate
      Not precisely determined; vague.


E.g.
 The police are looking for a tall white bearded man of indeterminate age who should be considered armed and dangerous.


When you determine something, you decide on whatitis, which means you put limit s or boundaries on it s identity. So something indeterminate lacks identifying limit s. A mut tis usually  the product of indeterminate breeding, since at least  the  father's  identity  is  generally  a mystery. A painting of indeterminate origins is normally less valued than one with the painter's name on it . And if negotiations are leftin an indeterminate state, nothing has been decided.
 
interminable
    Having or seeming to have no end; tiresomely drawn out .


E.g.
 The preacher was making another of his interminable pleas for money, so she snapped off the TV.


Nothing is literally endless, except maybe the universe and time it self, so interminable as we use it  is always an exaggeration. On an unlucky day you might  sit through an interminable meeting, have an interminable drive home in heavy traffic, and watch an interminable film-all in less than 24 hours.
 
terminus (1) The end of a travel route (such as a rail or bus line), or the station at the end of a route. (2) An extreme point ; tip.


E.g.
 They've been tracking the terminus of the glacier for 20 years, in which time ithas retreated 500 yards.


This word comes straight from Latin. In the Roman empire, a terminus was a boundary st one, and all boundary st ones had a minor god associated with them, whose name was Terminus. Terminus was a kind of keeper of the peace, since wherever there was a terminus there could be no argument s about where your property ended and your neighbor's property began. So Terminus even had his own festival, the Terminalia, when images of the god were draped with flower garlands. Today the word shows up in all kinds of places, including in the name of numerous hotels worldwide built near a city's railway terminus.
 
GEO comes from the Greek  word  for  "Earth." Geography  is  the  science  that  deals  with features of the Earth's surface. Geologists st udy rocks and soil to learn about the Earth's hist ory and resources. Geometry was originally about measuring portions of the Earth's surface, probably originally in order to determine where the boundaries of Egyptians' farms lay after the annual flooding by the Nile River.
 
geocentric
     Having or relating to the Earth as the center.


E.g.
 He claims that , if you aren'ta scientist , your consciousness is most ly geocentric for your entire life.


The idea that the Earth is the center of the universe and that the sun revolves around itis an ancient one, probably dating back to the  earliest  humans. Not  until 1543  did  the  Polish astronomer Copernicus publish his calculations proving that the Earth actually revolves around the sun, thus replacing the geocentric model with a heliocentric model (from Helios, the Greek god of the sun). But geocentrism remains central to various religious sect s around the world, and still t oday one in five adultamericans believes the sun revolves around the Earth.
 
geophysics              The  science  that  deals  with  the  physical  processes  and phenomena occurring especially in the Earth and in it s vicinity.


E.g.
 Located in the heart of oil and gas country, the university offers a degree in geophysics and many of it s graduates go straight to work for the oil and gas industry.


Geophysics applies the principles of physics to the st udy of the Earth. It deals with such things as the movement of the Earth's crustand the temperatures of it s interior. Another subjectis the behavior of the still-mysterious geomagnetic field. Some geophysicists seek out deposit s of ores or petroleum; others specialize in earthquakes; still others st udy the water beneath the Earth's surface, where it collect s and how it flows.
 
geostationary
   Being  or having  an  orbit  such  that  a  satellite remains in a fixed position above the Earth, especially having such an orbitabove the equat or.


E.g.
 It was the science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke who first conceived of a set of geostationary satellites as a means of worldwide communication.


We don't give much thought to geostationary satellites, but many of us rely on them daily. Anyone who watches satellite TV or listens to satellite radio is dependent on them; the weather phot os you see on TV are taken from geostationary satellites; and military information gathering via satellite goes on quiet ly day after day. (Though the satellites that provide GPS service for your car or cell phone actually aren't geostationary, since they orbit the Earth t wice a day.) By 2009 there were about 300 geostationary satellites in operation, all of them moving atan altit ude of about 22,000 miles. Since they hover above the same spot on Earth, your receiving dish or antenna doesn'thave to turn in order to track them.
 
geothermal
  Of, relating t o, or using the natural heat produced inside the Earth.


E.g.
 Geothermal power plant s convert underground water or steam to electricity.


Geothermal  comes  part ly  from  the  Greek thermos,  "hot " (see THERM/THERMO). Most geothermal electricity is provided by power plant s situated in areas where there is significantactivity of the Earth's great tect onic plates-often the same areas where volcanoes are found. Buthot water from deep underground may be used by cities far from volcanoes to heat buildings or sidewalks. And a newer source of geothermal energy relies on a less dramatic kind of heat : Individual homeowners can now install heat pumps that take advantage of the 50бу- 60бу temperature of the soil near the surface to provide heating in cold weather (and air- conditioning in the warm months). These very small-scale geothermal systems may eventually supply more useful energy than the large power plant s.
 

 
SPHER comes from the Greek word for "ball." A ball is it self a sphere, as is the ball that we call Earth. So is the atmosphere, and so are several other invisible "spheres" thatencircle the Earth.
 
spherical                         Relating to a sphere; shaped like a sphere or one of it s segment s.


E.g.
 The girls agreed that the spacecrafthad been deep blue and perfect ly spherical, and thatit s alien passengers had resembled large praying mantises.


Something spherical is like a sphere in being round, or more or less round, in three dimensions. Apples and oranges are both spherical, for example, even though they're never perfect ly round. A spheroid has a roughly spherical shape; so an asteroid, for instance, is often spheroidal- fairly round, but lumpy.
 
strat osphere                        (1) The part  of the earth's at mosphere that  extends from about seven to about 30 miles above the surface. (2) A very high or the highestregion.


E.g.
 In the celebrity strat osphere she now occupied, a fee of 12 million dollars per film was a reasonable rate.


The strat osphere (strato- simply means "layer" or "level") lies above the earth's weather and most ly changes very  lit t le. It  contains  the  ozone  layer, which  shields  us  from  the  sun's ultravioletradiation except where it 's been harmed by manmade chemicals. The levels of the atmosphere are marked particularly by their temperatures; stratospheric temperatures rise only to around 32бу-very moderate considering that temperatures in the troposphere below may descend to about -70бу and those in the ionosphere above may rise to 1000бу.
 
biosphere                        (1) The part of the world in which life can exist . (2) Living things and their environment .


E.g.
 The moon has no biosphere, so an artificial one would have to be constructed for any long- term stay.


The lithosphere is the solid surface of the earth (lith- meaning "rock"); the hydrosphere is the earth's water (hydro- means "water"), including the clouds and water vapor in the air; and the atmosphere is the earth's air (atmos- meaning "vapor"). The term biosphere can include all of these, along with the 10 million species of living things they contain. The biosphere recycles it s air, water, organisms, and minerals constant ly to maintain an amazingly balanced state; human beings should probably do their best to imitate it . Though the word has a new sound to it , it was first used over a hundred years ago.
 
hemisphere                      Half a sphere, especially half the global sphere as divided by the equat or or a meridian.


E.g.
 A sailor who crosses the equat or from the northern to the southern hemisphere for the first time is traditionally given a special initiation.


Hemisphere includes the prefix hemi-, meaning "half." The northern and southern hemispheres are divided by the equat or, the circle halfway bet ween Earth's two poles. The eastern and western hemispheres aren't divided so exact ly, since there are no poles in the Earth's east - west dimension. Often the dividing line is said to be the "prime meridian"-the imaginary north- south line thatruns through Greenwich, England, from which all longit ude is calculated (it self being the 0бу meridian). But for simplicity's sake, the eastern hemisphere is often said to include all of Europe, Africa, Australia, and Asia, while the western hemisphere contains North and South America and a great deal of ocean.
 
VERT comes from the Latin verb vertere, meaning "to turn" or "to turn around." Vertigo is the dizziness that  makes it  seem as if everything is turning around you. And an advertisement turns your at tention to a product or service.
 
divert                (1) To turn from one purpose or course to another. (2) To give pleasure to by distracting from burdens or distress.


E.g.
 The farmers had successfully diverted some of the river's water to irrigate their crops during the drought .


The Roman circus was used to provide diversion for it s citizens-and sometimes to divert their at tention from the government 's failings as well. The diversion was often in the form of a fight
-men pit ted against lions, bears, or each other-and the audience was sure to see blood and death. A diverting evening these days mightinstead include watching the same kind of mayhem on a movie screen.
 
converter             A device thatchanges something (such as radio signals, radio frequencies, or data) from one form to another.


E.g.
 She was so indifferent to television that she hadn'teven boughta converter, and her old TV sat there useless until she finally lugged it down to the recycling center.


Converters come in many forms. Travelers to foreign countries who bring along their electric razors or hair dryers always pack a small electric converter, which can change direct current to alternating current or vice versa. In 2009 millions of  Americans  bought  digital-analog converters, small box-shaped devices thatchange the new broadcast digital signal to the analog signal that older TV set s were made to receive. A catalytic converter is the pollution- control device at tached to your car's exhaust system that convert s pollutant s such as carbon monoxide into harmless form.
 
avert                   (1) To turn (your eyes or gaze) away or aside. (2) To avoid or prevent .


E.g.
 General Camacho's announcement of lower food prices averted an immediate worker's revolt .


Sensitive people avert their eyes from gory accident s and scenes of disaster. But the accident or disaster mightit self have been averted if someone had been alertenough. Negotiat ors may averta strike by all-night talks. In the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, it seemed that  nuclear catastrophe was barely averted. Aversion means "dislike or disgust "-thatis, your feeling about something you can't stand to look at .
 
revert                 (1) To go back or return (to an earlier state, condition, situation, et c.). (2) To be given back to (a former owner).


E.g.
 Control of the Panama Canal Zone, firstacquired by the U.S. in 1903, reverted to the local governmentin 1999.


Since the prefix re- often means "back" (see RE-), the basic meaning of revertis "turn back." Revertand reversion  often  show up  in legal document s, since  property is often  given to another person on the condition thatit will revert to the original owner at some future date or when something happens (usually the death of the second person). In nonlegal uses, the word tends to show up in negative context s. Many reformed drinkers, for example, eventually revert to their old ways, and most people revert to smoking at least once or t wice before succeeding in quit ting for good.
 

 
MORPH comes from the Greek word for "shape." Morph is it self an English word with a brand- new meaning, which was needed when we began to digitally alter phot ographic images or shapes to make them move or transform themselves in often ast onishing ways.
 
amorphous                           Withouta definite shape or form; shapeless.


E.g.
 Picking up an amorphous lump of clay, she molded it swift ly into a rough human shape.


According to the Greek myths of the creation, the world began in an amorphous state; and the Bible states that , at the beginning, "the earth was without form, and void." Most of us have had night mares that consist most ly of justa looming amorphous but terrifying thing. A plan may have so lit t le detail that critics call itamorphous. And a new word may appear to name a previously amorphous group of people, such as yuppie in 1983 and Generation X six years later.
 
anthropomorphic
          (1) Having or described as having human form or trait s. (2) Seeing human trait s in nonhuman things.


E.g.
 The old, diseased tree had always been like a companion to her, though she didn'treally approve of such anthropomorphic feelings.


Anthropomorphic means a couple of different things. In it s first sense, an anthropomorphic cup is a cup in the shape of a human, and anthropomorphic gods are human in appearance-like the Greek and Roman gods, for example, even though Socrates and others believed that their fellow Greeks had created the gods in their own image rather than the other way around. In it s second sense, the animal characters in Aesop's fables are anthropomorphic since they all have human feelings and thought s even though they don't look like humans. Thus, when the fox calls the grapes sour simply because they're out of reach, it 's a very human response. Thousands of years after Aesop, anthropomorphism is still alive and well, in the animal st ories of Beatrix Pot ter, George Orwell's Animal Farm, and hundreds of cart oons and comic strips.
 
metamorphosis
   (1)   A    physical    change,   especially    one supernaturally caused. (2) A developmental change in an animal that occurs after birth or hatching.


E.g.
 Day by day the class watched the gradual metamorphosis of the tadpoles into frogs.


Many ancient myths end in a metamorphosis. As Apollo is chasing the nymph Daphne, she calls on her river-god father for help and he turns her into a laurel tree to save her. Out of anger and jealousy, the goddess Athena turns the marvelous weaver Arachne into a spider that will spin only beautiful webs. But natural substances may also metamorphose, or undergo metamorphosis. Heatand pressure over thousands of years may eventually turn tiny organisms into petroleum, and  coal  into  diamonds.  And  the  most  beloved  of  natural metamorphoses (notice how this plural is formed) is probably the transformation of caterpillars into but terflies.
 
morphology
   (1) The st udy of the structure and form of plant s and animals.
(2) The st udy of word formation.


E.g.
 The morphology of the mouthpart s of the different mayfly species turns out to be closely related to what they feed on and their methods of eating.


Within the field of biology, morphology is the st udy of the shapes and arrangement of part s of organisms, in order to determine their function, their development , and how they may have been shaped by evolution. Morphology is particularly importantin classifying species, since it can often reveal how closely one species is related to another. Morphology is st udied within other sciences as well, including astronomy and geology. And in language, morphology considers where words come from and why they look the way they do.
 
FORM is the Latin root meaning "shape" or "form." When you march in formation, you're moving in ordered pat terns. And a formula is a standard form for expressing information, such as a rule writ ten in mathematical symbols, or the "Sincerely yours" that often ends a let ter.
 
format     (1) The shape, size, and general makeup of something. (2) A general plan, arrangement , or choice of material.


E.g.
 The new thesaurus would  be  published in  three format s: as a  hardcover book, a  large paperback, and a CD-ROM.


Formatis a word that seems to gain more uses with every decade. Traditionally, people used the word simply to refer to the design of a book or newspaper page, but t oday that 's only one of it s many meanings. TV news shows seem to change their format , or general form, as often as their anchorpeople, and show types such as situation comedy and crime drama are often called format s. When a radio station gives up playing pop music to became a talk station, it 's said to be switching format s. In the electronic age, formathas also become widely used as a verb; thus, organizing electronic data for st orage or other special uses is called format ting (or reformatting).
 
conform (1) To be similar or identical; to be in agreement or harmony. (2) To follow ordinary standards or cust oms.


E.g.
 My family was t oo odd to really conform to the lit t le t own's ideas about proper behavior, butit didn't seem to bother our neighbors t oo much.


Conform, with it s prefix con-, "with" or "t ogether," means basically "to adopt the form of those around you." Thus, employee behavior must  usually conform with basic company policies. A certain philosophy may be said to conform with American values (even if we sometimes have a hard time agreeing on exact ly what those are). And a Maine Coon cat or a Dandie Dinmont  terrier must conform to it s breed requirement s in order to be registered for breeding purposes. Being  a conformist  is  usually  a  safe  bet ;  being  a nonconformist,  who  ignores  society's standards and the whole idea of conformity, can be a bit dangerous butalso sometimes more fun.
 
formality
   (1) An established cust om or way of behaving thatis required or standard. (2) The following of conventional rules.


E.g.
 The bride and groom wanted a small, intimate wedding withoutall the usual formalities.


Formal behavior follows the proper forms or cust oms, and informal behavior feels free to ignore them. The formality of a dinner party is indicated by such formalities as invitations, required dress, and full table set tings. Legal formalities, or technicalities, may turn out to be all-importanteven if they often seem minor. America requires fewer formalities than many other countries (in Germany, for example, you may know someone for years before using his or her first name), buteven in relaxed situations Americans may be observing invisible formalities.
 
formative                         (1) Giving or able to give form or shape; constructive. (2) Having to do with important growth or development .


E.g.
 She lived in Venezuela during her formative years and grew up speaking both Spanish and English.


Whatever gives shape to something else may be called formative: for example, the Grand Canyon is a product of the formative power of water, and the aut omobile was a huge formative influence on the design of America's cities. Butit usually applies to some kind of shaping thatisn't physical. An ambitious plan, for example, goes through a formative stage of development . The formative years of the U.S. included experimentation with various forms of government . And the mostimportant formative experiences in our own lives tend to take place in the first 20 years or so.
 

 
DOC/DOCT comes from the Latin docere, which means "to teach." So, for instance, a doctor was originally a highly educated person capable of instructing others in a field-which usually wasn't medicine.
 
doctrine                        (1) Something thatis taught . (2) An official principle, opinion, or belief.


E.g.
 According to the 19th-century doctrine of "papal infallibility," a pope's official statement s on mat ters of faith and morals must be regarded as the absolute truth.


The original doctrines were those of the Catholic Church, especially as taught by the so-called doctors (religious scholars) of the Church. But t oday a doctrine can come from many other sources. Old and established legal principles are called legal doctrine. Traditional psychiatrist s still follow the doctrines of Sigmund Freud. Communist doctrine in the 1920s and '30s was often the teachings of Lenin, which were then regarded in the Soviet Union as almost sacred.
U.S. president s have given their names to doctrines as well: In 1823 the Monroe Doctrine stated that the United States would oppose European influence in the Americas, and in 1947 the Truman Doctrine held thatamerica would support free countries againstenemies out side and inside.
 
docent                        (1) Teacher, lecturer. (2) A person who leads guided t ours, especially through a museum.


E.g.
 Visit ors to Istanbul's great Topkapi Museum often decide they need to hire an English- speaking docent .


The tit le of docentis used in many countries for whatamericans would call an associate professor-thatis, a college or university teacher who has been given tenure (see tenure) buthasn'tyetachieved the rank of full professor. Butin the U.S. a docentis a guide who works ata museum, a hist orical site, or even a zoo or a park. Docent s are usually volunteers, and their services are often free of charge.
 
doctrinaire
Tending to apply  principles  or  theories  without  regard  for practical difficulties or individual circumstance.


E.g.
 She had never taken a doctrinaire approach to teaching, since education theories didn'talways match the reality of instructing 25 lively st udent s.


Someone doctrinaire sticks closely to official doctrines or principles. A doctrinaire judge will give identical sentences to everyone found guilty of a particular crime. A doctrinaire feminist may treatall men as if they were identical. A doctrinaire economist might call for a single solution for the economic problems in all countries, regardless of their social and cultural hist ory. As you might guess, the word isn't often used in positive context s.
 
indoctrinate                        (1) To teach, especially basics or fundamentals. (2) To fill someone with a particular opinion or point of view.


E.g.
 In the Army's basic training, sergeant s have 11 weeks to indoctrinate their new recruit s with army at tit udes and discipline.


Indoctrinate simply means "brainwash" to many people t oday. We frequent ly hear, for example, of religious cult s thatindoctrinate their members to give up their freedom and individuality and to work hard only for a leader's goals. Butit s meaning wasn't originally negative atall. And the factis thatevery society indoctrinates it s young people with the values of it s culture; in the
U.S. we tend to be indoctrinated to love freedom, to be individuals, and to work hard for success, among many other things. But we now rarely use indoctrinate (or it s noun, indoctrination) in a positive way; instead we usually stick to the simpler and safer teach or instruct.
 
TUT/TUI comes from a Latin verb meaning "to look after," and in English the root generally shows up in words thatinclude the meaning "guide," "guard," or "teach"-such as tutor, the name for a private teacher who guides a st udent (or tutee) through a subject .
 
t ut orial                        (1) A class for one st udent  or a small group of st udent s. (2) An instructional program that gives information abouta specific subject .


E.g.
 He'd been taking t ut orials with the same graduate st udent for two years, and learning far more than he'd ever learned in his large classes.


Tut orials with live t ut ors are useful for both advanced st udent s and struggling ones. Many computer programs include electronic t ut orials to help the new user get used to the program, leading him or her through all it s functions, often by means of pictures and short videos. Buta really difficult program may still require a real-life t ut or to be fully underst ood.
 
t uition                         (1) The act of teaching; instruction. (2) The cost of or payment for instruction.


E.g.
 As she happily flipped through her college catalogs, her parent s sat quiet ly but uneasily calculating the t otal t uition cost s.


The sense of tuition meaning "teaching" or "instruction" is most ly used in Britain t oday. In the U.S., tuition almostalways means the cost s charged by a school, college, or university for that teaching. Those cost s have tended to rise atan alarming rate in recentyears. Around 2010 a st udent could receive a four-year college education (t uition, room, and board) atan inexpensive public university for less than $50,000, but mighthave to pay more than $200,000 atan expensive private college or university.
 
int uition
   (1)  The  power  of  knowing  something  immediately  without mental effort ; quick insight . (2) Something known in this way.


E.g.
 She scoffed at the notion of "women's int uition," special powers of insightand understanding in personal relations that women are supposed to have.


Intuition is very close in meaning to instinct. The momenta man enters a room you may feel you know intuitively or instinctively everything abouthim-thatis, you may intuithis basic personality. Highly rational people may try to ignore their int uition and insist on being able to explain everything they think, butartist s and creative thinkers often tend to rely on their intuitive sense of things. Int uition can be closely related to their imagination, which seems to come from somewhere justas mysterious. Some psychologist s claim that the left brain is mainly involved in logical thinking and the right brain in int uitive thinking; but the brain is terribly complex, and even if there's some truth to this idea, it 's not terribly obvious how to make use of it .
 
t utelage                    Instruction or guidance of an individual; guardianship.


E.g.
 Under the old man's expert t utelage, they had learned to carve and paint beautiful and realistic duck decoys.


Tutelage usually means specialized and individual guidance. Alexander the Great  was under the t utelage of the philosopher Arist ot le bet ween the ages of 13 and 16, and his tutor inspired him with a love of philosophy, medicine, and science. At 16 he commanded his firstarmy, and by his death 16 years later he had founded the greatestempire ever seen. Butit 's not so easy to trace the effect s of the brilliant t utelage he had received in his youth.
 

 
Number Words

DI/DUP, Greek and Latin prefixes meaning "t wo," show up in both technical and nontechnical terms, with dup- sometimes shortened to du-. So a duel is a bat t le bet ween two people. A duetis music for a duo, or pair of musicians. A duplicate is an exact copy, or t win. And if you have dual citizenship, you belong to two countries at once.
 
dichot omy
(1) A division into two often contradict ory groups. (2) Something with qualities that seem to contradicteach other.


E.g.
 Already in her first job, she noticed a dichot omy bet ween the theories she'd been taughtin college and the realities of professional life.


In the modern world there's a dichot omy bet ween fastand intense big-city life and the slower and more relaxed life in the country. But the dichot omy is nothing new: the Roman poethorace was complaining aboutitin the 1st century B.C. Among other eternal dichot omies, there's the dichot omy bet ween wealth and poverty, bet ween the policies of the leading political parties, bet ween a government 's words and it s actions-and bet ween what would be most fun to do right this minute and what would be the mature and sensible alternative.
 
dimorphic                          Occurring in two distinguishable forms (as of color or size).


E.g.
 One of a birder's challenges is identifying birds of the less colorful sex in dimorphic species.


Dimorphism varies great ly in the animal kingdom. Among mammals, the male is generally larger than the female, but other differences in appearance tend to be modest . But birds are usually noticeably dimorphic, with the male being the more colorful sex; when we imagine a pheasant , a mallard, a cardinal, or a peacock, we're almostalways picturing the male rather than the female. Among spiders the situation is  often reversed. The golden orb-weaver spider, for example, is spectacularly dimorphic: the female may be 20 times the size of the male, and she usually ends up eating him, sometimes even while he's mating with her. Many sea creatures, including many fish, take care of gender problems by simply changing from one sex into the other.
 
duplex          (1)  Having  two principal  element s;  double.  (2)  Allowing  electronic communication in two directions at the same time.


E.g.
 The upper floor of their splendid duplex apart menthad a panoramic view of Paradise Park.


Duplex can describe a confusing variety of things, depending on the technical field. Most of us use itas a noun: a duplex can be either a t wo-family house or a t wo-st ory apart ment . In computer science and telecommunications, duplex (or full-duplex) communication can go in both directions at once, while half-duplex communication can go only one way ata time. In other areas, just translate duplex as "double" and see if the sentence makes sense.
 
duplicity                          Deception by pretending to feel and act one way while acting in another.


E.g.
 By the time Jackie's duplicity in the whole mat ter had come to light , she had left t own, leaving no forwarding address.


The Greek god Zeus often resorted to duplicity to get whathe wanted, and most of the time whathe wanted was some woman. His duplicity usually involved a disguise: he appeared to Leda as a swan, and to Europa as a bull. Sometimes he had to be duplicitous to getaround his wife, Hera. After he had had his way with Io and was about to get caught , he turned her into a cow to avoid Hera's anger.
 
BI/BIN also means "t wo" or "double." A bicycle has two wheels, and binoculars consist of two lit t le telescopes. Bigamy is marriage to two people at once. And a road built through the middle of a neighborhood bisects itinto two pieces.
 
bipartisan
Involving members of two political parties.


E.g.
 The president named a bipartisan commission of three Republicans and three Democrat s to look into the issue.


Partisan means basically "belonging to a party," so something bipartisan combines two parties. Since the United States t oday operates with a t wo-party system of government (even though the Constit ution says nothing about parties atall), legislation often musthave some bipartisan supportin order to pass into law. Bipartisan commit tees review legislation, compromising on some point s and removing or adding others in order to make the bill more agreeable to both parties and make bipartisan support from the entire legislature or Congress more likely.
 
binary                      (1)  Consisting  of  two things  or  part s; double. (2)  Involving  a  choice bet ween two alternatives.


E.g.
 The Milky Way contains numerous binary stars, each consisting of two stars orbiting each other.


Binary has many uses, most of them in technical terms. Almostall computer soft ware, for example, is writ ten in binary code, which uses only two digit s, 0 and 1, 0 standing for a low- voltage impulse ("off") and 1 standing for a high-voltage impulse ("on"). All information is keptin this form. The word "HELLO," for example, looks like this: 1001000 1000101 1001100 1001100 1001111.
 
biennial                     (1) Occurring every two years. (2) Continuing or lasting over two years.


E.g.
 The great biennial show of new artin Venice usually either puzzles or angers the critics.


Biennial conventions, celebrations, competitions, and sport s event s come every two years. Biennials are plant s that live two years, bearing flowers and fruit only in the second year. (Carrot s and sugar beet s are two examples; since we're only interested in their root s, we don't waitanother year to see their flower and fruit .) In contrast , semiannual means "t wice a year." But no one can agree whether biweekly means "t wice a week" or "every two weeks," and whether bimonthly means "t wice a month" or "every two months." Maybe we should st op using both of them until we can decide.
 
bipolar                     Having two opposed forces or views; having two poles or opposed point s of at traction.


E.g.
 Our bipolar Earth spins on an axis thatextends bet ween the North and South Poles.


Magnet s are always bipolar: one pole at tract s and the other repels or drives away. And the Cold War arms race was bipolar, since it mainly involved the opposing powers of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. But the word is encountered most often t oday in bipolar disorder, the newer name of what used to be called manic-depressive illness, in which the person tends to swing bet ween the two extremes, or poles, of high intensity and deep depression, with depression being the main condition. Though an extremely serious illness, bipolar disorder can often be controlled by the drug lithium.

ACER/ACR comes from the Latin adjective acer, meaning "sharp" or "sour." Grapefruitand limes have an acid taste; acid can also describe a person's sense of humor (other words for it might be sharp or biting). The acidity of the soil often indicates whether it 's good for growing certain crops; blueberries, for instance, love acid soil, so they're more likely to be found east of the Mississippi River, where acid soil is the rule.
 
acerbic                         Sharp or biting in temper, mood, or t one.


E.g.
 She had enjoyed his acerbic humor for years, but then a friend t old her about the nasty jokes he was making abouther behind her back.


Acerbic often describes wit . An acerbic critic won't make many friends among the writers or artist s whose work is  being  criticized, but  often  keeps  his  or  her  readers  amused  and entertained. Acerbity may be slight ly less sharp than sarcasm, but not much; both words have root s meaning basically "cut ."
 
acrid                    Unpleasant ly sharp and harsh; bit ter.


E.g.
 The acrid odor of gunpowder hung in the air long after the shot s' echoes had died away.


Acrid exact ly fit s the smoke from a fire-a burning building or forest , for example. Dense smog may castan acrid pall over a city, making throat s burn and eyes sting. But , like acid and acerbic, acrid sometimes also describes nonphysical things, such as the remarks of a bit ter person.
 
acrimony
      Harsh or bit ter sharpness in words, manner, or temper.


E.g.
 Town meetings here were usually civilized, and no one could recall an issue thathad ever aroused such intense acrimony as the new pulp mill.


Acrimony is angry harshness that usually springs from intense personal dislike. An acrimonious exchange is full of cut ting, unpleasantremarks designed to hurt . Civil wars are often more acrimonious and bloody than foreign wars. In the same way, a bad divorce may be more acrimonious than any other kind of legal bat t le.
 
exacerbate
To make worse, more violent , or more severe.


E.g.
 The increase in coal-burning power plant s has great ly exacerbated the buildup of greenhouse gases.


To exacerbate is not to cause, but only to make something bad even worse. So the loss of a major industry in a city may exacerbate it s already serious unemployment problem. A vicious remark can exacerbate a quarrel. Building a new mall may exacerbate an area's existing traffic problems. A new drug can exacerbate the side effect s of the drug a patientis already taking. It used to be thought that t oo much blood in the body exacerbated a fever, so the patient 's blood would be drained, often by means of leeches-and notall patient s survived.
 
STRICT comes from the Latin verb meaning "to draw tight , bind, or tie." So the English word strict means "tight ly controlled." And when someone begins a sentence "Strict ly speaking, . . ." you know he or she is going to be talking abouta word or idea in it s most limited sense, "drawing tight " the meaning till it 's as narrow as possible.
 
stricture                          (1) A law or rule that limit s or controls something; restriction. (2) A strong criticism.


E.g.
 There are severe legal strictures on the selling of marijuana in almostevery state.


Stricture has meant many things through the centuries, and it s "restriction" meaning-probably the most  common one t oday-is actually the most  recent . High-school teachers often put strictures on texting during class. Cities concerned about their murder rate have slapped strictures on the possession of handguns. And the United Nations may vote to put strictures on arms sales to a  country  that  keeps  violating  international treaties. With  the  meaning "strong criticism," stricture is slight ly old-fashioned t oday, butit 's still used by intellectuals. So, for example, an article may amount to a harsh stricture on the whole medical profession, or an artreview may justexpress the critic's strictures on sentimental paintings of cute lit t le houses with glowing windows.
 
restrictive                   (1) Serving or likely to keep within bounds. (2) Serving or tending to place under limit s as to use.


E.g.
 The deed to the property had a restrictive covenant forbidding any development of the land for 50 years.


Restrictive covenant s (thatis, agreement s) in real-estate deeds were once used to forbid the buyer from ever selling the property to anyone of another race. These are now illegal, though other kinds of restrictive covenant s are very common; in some neighborhoods, they may even tell you what colors you can't paintyour house. In grammar, a restrictive clause is one that limit s the meaning of something that comes before it . In the sentence "That 's the professor who I'm trying to avoid," "who I'm trying to avoid" is a restrictive clause, since it 's whatidentifies the professor. Butin the sentence "That 's my Hist ory professor, who I'm trying to avoid," the same clause is nonrestrictive, since the professor has already been identified as "my Hist ory professor." There should always be a comma before a nonrestrictive clause, but not before a restrictive clause.
 
constrict (1) To draw t ogether or make narrow. (2) To limit .


E.g.
 She felt that small t owns, where everyone seems to know every move you make and is just waiting to gossip aboutit , can constrictyour life terribly.


Arteries constricted by cholesterol slow the flow of blood, justas traffic arteries or highways constricted  by  accident s  slow  the  flow  of  traffic.  But constriction  isn't  always  physical. Economic growth may be constricted by trade barriers. A narrow, constricted life may be the result  of poverty or lack of opport unity. And an actress may feel constricted by a role she played as a child or by her TV character from years ago, which the public refuses to forget .
 
vasoconstrict or
  Something such as a nerve fiber or a drug that narrows a blood vessel.


E.g.
 For operations like this, my dentist likes to use a vasoconstrict or to keep bleeding to a minimum.


Our blood vessels are constant ly narrowing and widening in response to our activity or our environment , constricting in order to retain body heatand widening to getrid of excess heat . So when we're hot our skin flushes, and when we're very cold we become pale. Since the width of the blood vessels affect s blood pressure, vasoconstrict ors are prescribed to treat low blood pressure. Vasoconstrict ors include antihistamines and amphetamines, as well as nicotine and caffeine; we commonly buy them for our runny noses and bloodshoteyes as well. The opposite of vasoconstrict ors are vasodilators, which are commonly used to treathigh blood pressure.
 

 
STRU/STRUCT comes from the Latin verb struere, meaning "to put t ogether, build, arrange." A structure is something that 's been constructed,-thatis, built or put t ogether. Instructions tell how the pieces should be arranged. Something that obstructs is a barrier that 's been "built " to stand in your way. And something destructive "unbuilds."
 
deconstruction
          Analysis  of  text s, works  of  art , and  cultural pat terns thatis intended to expose the assumptions on which they are based, especially by exposing the limitations of language.


E.g.
 Deconstruction  has  been  performed  on Huckleberry Finn by English professors so many times thatit 's a wonder there's anything left of it .


Deconstruction doesn'tactually mean "demolition"; instead it means "breaking down" or analyzing something (especially the words in a work of fiction or nonfiction) to discover it s true significance, which is supposedly almost never exact ly what the author intended. A feminist may deconstructan old novel to show how even an innocent -seeming st ory somehow depends on the oppression of women. A new western may deconstruct the myths of the old Westand show lawmen as vicious and criminals as flawed but decent . Table manners, The Sound of Music, and cosmetics ads have all been the subject s of deconstructionistanalysis. Of course, noteveryone agrees with deconstructionistinterpretations, and some people reject the whole idea of deconstruction, but most of us have run into it by now even if we didn'trealize it .
 
infrastructure
      (1) The underlying foundation or basic framework. (2) A system of public works.


E.g.
 The public loved her speeches about crime but dozed off when she brought up highway repair and infrastructure deterioration.


Infra- means "below"; so the infrastructure is the "underlying structure" of a country and it s economy, the fixed installations thatit needs in order to function. These include roads, bridges, dams, the water and sewer systems, railways and subways, airport s, and harbors. These are generally government -builtand publicly owned. Some people also speak about such things as the intellectual infrastructure or the infrastructure of science research, but the meaning of such notions can be extremely vague.
 
construe                        (1) To explain the arrangementand meaning of words in a sentence.
(2) To understand or explain; interpret .


E.g.
 She asked how I had construed his laste-mail, and I t old her that something aboutithad left me very worried.


Construe can usually be translated as "interpret ." It 's often used in law; thus, an At t orney General might construe the term "serious injury" in a child-abuse law to include bruises, or a judge might construe language about gift s to "heirs" to include spouses. The IRS's construal of some of your activities might be different from your own-and much more expensive at tax time. Construing is also close to translating; so  when  the  British  say  "public  school,"  for instance, it should be construed or translated as "prep school" in American terms.
 
instrumental
(1) Acting as a means, agent , or t ool. (2) Relating to an instrument , especially a musical instrument .


E.g.
 His mother had been instrumental in starting the new art s program at the school, for which she was honored at the spring ceremony.


A n instrumentis a t ool, something used to construct. It 's often a t ool for making music. A musical saw happens to be a carpenter's t ool that can be played with a violin bow (though you probably wouldn't want to play a wrench or a pair of pliers). The musical meanings of instrumental, as in "It start s with an instrumental piece" or "a jazz instrumental," are common. But the meanings "helpful," "useful," and "essential," as in "He was instrumental in get ting my book published," are justas common.
 
PROP/PROPRI comes from the Latin word proprius, meaning "own." A proprietor is an owner, and property is whathe or she owns. And the original meaning of proper was "belonging to oneself," so a writer around the year 1400 could say "With his own proper sword he was slain," even if we might not say it quite the same way t oday.
 
proprietary
     (1) Relating to an owner or propriet or; made or sold by one who has the sole right to do so. (2) Privately owned and run as a profit -making organization.


E.g.
 The local hospital was a not -for-profitinstit ution, whereas the nearby nursing homes were proprietary.


A proprietary process is a manufacturing process that others are forbidden to use, and a proprietary trademark is a name that only the owner can use. Legal right s of this kind are ensured by copyright s and patent s. After a certain period of time, inventions and processes lose their legal protection, cease to be proprietary, and enter the "public domain," meaning thateveryone can use them freely. Baseball fans often take a proprietary at tit ude t oward their favorite team-thatis, they behave more or less as if they own it , even though the only thing they may own is the right to yell from a bleacher seat till the end of a game.
 
propriety                   (1)  The  state  of  being  proper;  appropriateness.  (2)  Acting according to whatis socially acceptable, especially in conduct bet ween the sexes.


E.g.
 Propriety used to forbid a young unmarried man and woman to go almostanywhere withoutan adult .


In an earlier era, when social manners were far more elaborate than they are t oday, propriety and impropriety were words in constant use. Today we're more likely to use them in other context s. We may talk  about  the  propriety  of  government  officials'  dealings  with  private citizens, the propriety of the relationship bet ween a lawyer and a judge, or the impropriety of speaking out of turn in a meeting that follows Robert 's rules of order. Relations bet ween men and women still present  questions of propriety, but  t oday it 's often in the workplace rather than in social set tings. Wherever rules, principles, and standard procedures have been clearly stated, propriety can become an issue. Something improper usually isn'tactually illegal, butit makes people uncomfortable by giving the impression that something isn't quite right .
 
appropriate
   (1) To take exclusive possession of, often withoutright . (2) To setapart for a particular purpose or use.


E.g.
 It was one of those insulting words that sometimes getappropriated by a group thatit 's meant to insult , which then start s using it proudly and defiant ly.


From it s root s, the verb appropriate would mean basically "make one's own"-thatis, "take," or sometimes "grab." Each year the Presidentand Congress create a budgetand appropriate funds for each item in it , funds which most ly come in the form of taxes from the public. In the House of Representatives, the powerful Appropriations Commit tee often get s the last word on how much money goes to each program. "Misappropriation of funds," on the other hand, is a nice way of saying "theft ." If someone appropriated pieces of your novel, you might take him or her to court ; and if you appropriated trade secret s from your former employers, you might be the one sued.
 
expropriate
 (1) To take away the right of possession or ownership. (2) To transfer to oneself.


E.g.
 It was only when the country's new government threatened to expropriate the American oil refineries that Congress became alarmed.


In ancientrome, an emperor could condemn a wealthy senat or, have him killed, and expropriate his property. In 1536 Henry V I declared himself head of the new Church of England and expropriated the lands and wealth of the Roman Catholic monasteries. And nearly all of North America was expropriated from the American Indians, usually withoutany paymentatall. Today, democratic government s only carry out  legal expropriations, in which the owners are properly paid for their land-for example, when a highway or other public project needs to be built .
 

 
TORT comes from a form of the Latin verb torquere, meaning "to t wist , wind, or wrench." In torture, part s of the body may be wrenched or t wisted or stretched; so those "Indian sunburns" that schoolkids give by t wisting in different directions on some unlucky guy's wrist stay pret ty close to torture's original meaning.
 
t ort         A wrongful act that does notinvolve breach of contractand for which the injured party can receive damages in a civil action.


E.g.
 The manufacturer was almost bankrupted by the massive t ortactions brought by employees harmed by asbest os.


Tort came into English straight from French many centuries ago, and it still looks a lit t le odd. It s root meaning of "t wisted" (as opposed to "straight ") obviously came to mean "wrong" (as opposed to "right "). Every first -year law st udent  takes a course in the important  subject  of t ort s. Tort s include all the so-called "product -liability" cases, against manufacturers of cars, household product s, children's t oys, and so on. They also cover dog bites, slander and libel, and a huge variety of other very personal cases of injury, both mental and physical-Tort s class is never dull. If you're sued for a t ortand lose, you usually have to pay "damages"-thatis, a sum of money-to the person who you wronged.
 
ext ort                     To obtain from a person by force, threat s, or illegal power.


E.g.
 She had tried to ext ort money from a film star, claiming thathe was the father of her baby.


To ext ortis literally to wrench something out of someone. Extortion is a mainstay of organized crime. Justas the school bully ext ort s lunch money from the smaller kids in exchange for not beating them up, thugs ext ort "protection" money from business owners with threat s of violence. But that 's only one kind of ext ortion; a mobster mightext ort favors from a politician with threat s of revealing some dark secret , justas you mightext orta favor from a brother or sister by promising not to tell on them.
 
cont ort                       To t wistin a violent manner.


E.g.
 The governor's explanation of his affair was so cont orted thatit only made mat ters worse for him.


Circus contortionists are known for t wisting their bodies into pret zels; such contortions tend to be easier for females than for males, and much easier for the young than for the old. When trying to say something uncomfortable or  dishonest ,  people  often  go  through  verbal cont ortions. But when someone else "t wist s" something you said or did, we usually say instead that they've distorted it .
 
t ort uous
     (1) Having many t wist s, bends, or turns; winding. (2) Crooked or tricky; involved, complex.


E.g.
 The road over the mountains was long and dangerously t ort uous, and as you rounded the sharp corners you could never see whether a huge truck might be barreling down t oward you.


A labyrinth is a t ort uous maze. The first labyrinth was builtas a prison for the monstrous Minotaur, half bull and half man; only by holding one end of a thread was the heroic Theseus able to enter and slay the Minotaur and then exit . A t ort uous problem, a t ort uous hist ory, and  the t ort uous path of a bill through Congress all have many unexpected t wist s and turns; a t ort uous explanation or argument may be t oo crooked for it s own good. Don't confuse tortuous with torturous, which means "t ortured" or "painfully unpleasant "; tortuous has nothing to do with t orture.
 
VIV comes from vivere, the Latin verb meaning "to live or be alive." A survivor has lived through something terrible. A revival brings something back to life, whether it 's an old film, interestin a long-dead novelist , or religious enthusiasm in a group, maybe in a huge tentin the countryside.
 
vivacious
Lively in an at tractive way.


E.g.
 For the cheerleading squad, only the most out going, energetic, and vivacious of the st udent s getchosen.


Vivacious can be used to describe a piece of music or writing, butit 's generally used t oday to describe people, and particularly women. The main female characters in Shakespeare's plays- Beatrice in Much Ado About Nothing , Rosalind in As You Like It, and Portia in The Merchant of Venice, for example-are often full of humor, spirit , and vivacity.
 
bon vivant
      A sociable person with a love of excellent food and drink.


E.g.
 My uncle and aunt were bons vivant s, and could usually be found in the evening ata swank midt own bar surrounded by a crowd of tipsy merrymakers.


Bon vivant comes straight from French, where it means literally "good liver," and is still pronounced in the French way, though we've actually been using itin English since the 17th century. A proper bon vivanthas some money and lot s of friends and plenty of style and knows a good wine and can tell a great st ory and loves to laugh. Because of all these requirement s, true bons vivant s are rather rare-but that doesn't mean there aren't plenty of people who hope to be one someday.
 
revivify                           To give new life t o; bring back to life.


E.g.
 All their effort s to revivify the boys' club seemed to be get ting them nowhere, till one of the board members had a greatidea.


Worn-out soil may be revivified by careful organic tending. A terrific new recruit can revivify a discouraged foot ball team, and an imaginative and energetic new principal can revivify a failing high school. After World War I, one European country after another was slowly revivified, their economies and cultural life gradually coming back to life. Notice thatrevivify looks like some other words with very similar meanings, such as revive, revitalize, and reinvigorate.
 
vivisection
 Operation  on  living  animals,  often  for  experimental purposes.


E.g.
 The lab at tempt s to avoid vivisection in it s research, concentrating instead on alternative methods thathave been developed.


Vivisection includes the Latin root sect, meaning "cut ." The Greek physician Galen, who lived during the 2nd century A.D., practiced vivisection on live monkeys and dogs to learn such things as the role of the spinal cord in muscle activity and whether veins and arteries carry air or blood; his findings formed the basis of medical practice for more than a thousand years. Vivisection continues to be used in drug and medical research t oday, but often in secret , since it makes most people very uncomfortable and some groups are violent ly opposed to it .
 

 
SERV means "to be subject t o." A servantis the person who serves you with meals and provides other necessary services. A tennis or volleyball serve put s the ball in play, much as a servant put s food on the table.
 
serviceable
(1) Helpful or useful. (2) Usable.


E.g.
 In the at tic they found some chairs and a table, which, with a new coat of paint , became quite serviceable for informal get -t ogethers.


Someone who speaks serviceable Spanish isn't fluentin it but get s by pret ty well. A serviceable jacketis practical and maybe even rugged. But serviceable sometimes damns with faint praise. A serviceable performance is all right but notinspired. Serviceable curtains aren't  the ideal color or pat tern, but they serve their purpose. A serviceable pair of shoes is sturdy but won't win you any fashion point s.
 
servile                    (1) Suitable to a servant . (2) Humbly submissive.


E.g.
 The dog's manner was servile, and it lacked a healthy independence.


During the Middle Ages, most of the farming was done by a servile class known as serfs, who enjoyed hardly any personal freedom. This began to change in the 14th century; but the Russian serfs weren't freed until the 1860s, when the servile class in the U.S. was also freed. But servile t oday usually refers to a personal manner; a person who shows servility usually isn'ta servant, but simply seems t oo eager to please and seems to lack self-respect .
 
servit ude
  A state or condition of slavery or bondage to another.


E.g.
 She spentan entire summer working ata resort under conditions that felt like ut ter servit ude.


Servit ude is slavery or anything resembling it . The entire black population of colonial America lived in permanent servit ude. And millions of the whites who populated this country arrived in "indentured servit ude," obliged to pay off the cost of their journey with several years of labor. Servit ude comes in many forms, of course: in the bad old days of the British navy, it was said that the difference bet ween going to sea and going to jail was thatyou were less likely to drown in jail.
 
subservient                           (1) Serving or useful in an inferior situation or capacity. (2) Slavishly obedient .


E.g.
 Many have wondered why Congress always seems subservient to the financial industry, supporting iteven when the voters are angrily calling for reforms.


Since sub- means "below," itemphasizes the lower position of the person in the subservient one. Soldiers of a given rank are always subservient to those of a higher rank; this subservience is symbolized by the requirement that they salute  their  superior  at  every opport unity. Women have often been forced into subservientrelationships with men. A small nation may feel subservient to it s more powerful neighbor, obliged to obey even when it doesn't want t o. So subservience usually brings with ita good dose of resent ment .
 
CLUS comes from the Latin claudere, "to close." Words based on the Latin verb often have forms in which the d becomes an s. So, for example, include, which once meant "to shut up or enclose" and now means "to contain," has the related word inclusive, which means "including everything."
 
occlusion
 An obstruction or blockage; the act of obstructing or closing off.


E.g.
 The doct ors worry thata loosened piece of plaque from the artery wall could lead to an occlusion of a brain artery, resulting in a stroke.


Occlusion, formed with the prefix ob-, here meaning "in the way," occurs when something has been closed up or blocked off. Almostall heartat tacks are the result of the occlusion of a coronary (heart ) artery by a blood clot , and many strokes are caused by an occlusion in an artery serving the brain. When a person's upper and lower teeth form a malocclusion, they close incorrect ly or badly. An occlusion, or occluded front , happens when a fast -moving cold front overtakes a slow-moving warm frontand slides underneath it , lifting the warm air and blocking it s movement .
 
exclusive
 (1) Not  shared; available to only one person or group, especially those from a high social class. (2) Full and complete.


E.g.
 That technology is exclusive to one cell-phone manufacturer, but some of the others are dying to use it .


In words such as expel, export, and exclusive, the prefix ex- means "out of, out side." Thus, to exclude means basically to close the door in order to keep someone or something out . When the word appears in an advertisement , it 's often making an appeal to snobs. An "exclusive" offer is supposedly made to only a few people; not so many years ago, "exclusive" housing development s excluded those of a certain race or color. If a productis being sold exclusively by one st ore, you won't be able to find itanywhere else. When a newspaper or news show has an exclusive, it 's a st ory that no one else has yetreported. Exclusive's ant onym is inclusive; an inclusive policy, an inclusive church, or an inclusive approach is one that  aims to include as many people as possible.
 
recluse                      A person who lives withdrawn from society.


E.g.
 The lonely farmhouse was home to a middle-aged recluse, a st ooped, bearded man who would never answer the door when someone knocked.


Greta Garbo and Howard Hughes were two of the most famously reclusive celebrities of modern times. She had been a greatinternational star, called the most beautiful woman in the world; he had been an  aircraft  manufacturer and  film producer, with  one  of  the  greatest fort unes in the world. It seems that Garbo's reclusiveness resulted from her desire to leave her public with only the youthful image of her face. Hughes was terrified of germs, though that was the least of his problems.
 
seclusion                    (1) A screening or hiding from view. (2) A place thatis isolated or hidden.


E.g.
 The police immediately placed him in seclusion in a hospital room, with armed guards at the door.


With it s prefix se-, "apart ," seclusion has the basic meaning of a place or condition that 's "closed away." A lone island may be secluded, and it s seclusion might be whatit s owner prizes mostaboutit . President s and their staffs may go into seclusion before making critical decisions. Monastery life is purposely secluded, and monks may have taken vows to live lives of seclusion. The deadly brown recluse spider prefers seclusion butis sometimes disturbed by very unlucky people.
 

 
Greek and Latin Borrowings

acme                   Highest point ; summit , peak.


E.g.
 Last Saturday's upset vict ory over Michigan may prove to have been the acme of the entire season.


In Greek, acme meanta mountain peak, butin English we hardly ever use itin the physical sense. Instead we speak of someone's new job as the acme of her career, or of a certain leap as the acme of classical dance technique. In old Road Runner cart oons, the Acme Company is the provider of every ingenious device imaginable. But the word can'talways be taken quite literally as a brand or company name; it 's possible, for instance, that something called the Acme Bar & Grill may not be the absolutely highestand bestexample of a bar and grill. And don't confuse acme with acne, the skin disorder-even though both actually come from the same word.
 
catharsis
   A cleansing or purification of the body, emotions, or spirit .


E.g.
 Having broken down sobbing at the funeral, he said afterwards thatithad felt like a catharsis.


One of the earliest uses of catharsis is in Arist ot le's Poetics, where the philosopher claims that watching a tragedy provides the spectat ors with a desirable catharsis because of the buildup and release of the emotions of pity and fear. Sigmund Freud borrowed the term as a name for the process of bringing a set of unconscious desires and ideas back into consciousness in order to eliminate their bad effect s. Today some people claim it 's cathartic to merely express your anger or grief, since it "get s it out of your system." Laxatives are also called cathartic, since they provide a physical catharsis that some people believe to be healthful. But there's no general agreementaboutany of this, and the notion of catharsis remains a very personal one.
 
colossus                          (1) A gigantic stat ue. (2) A person or thing thatresembles such a stat ue in size or activity or influence.


E.g.
 Even if Citizen Kane had been his only movie, Orson Welles would be regarded as a colossus in the hist ory of film.


The original colossi (notice the plural form) were the larger-than-life stat ues made by the Greeks and Romans. The most famous of these was the Colossus of Rhodes, a stat ue of the sun god Helios built on the Greek island of Rhodes around 280 B.C. that was over 100 feet tall and t ook more than 12 years to build. The Stat ue of Liberty is a modern colossus, enormous and stately, at the entrance to New York Harbor. And someone who has played a colossal role in hist ory, such as Winst on Churchill, may be called a colossus as well.
 
detrit us                        Loose material thatresult s from disintegration; debris.


E.g.
 The base of the cliff was lit tered with the detrit us of centuries of erosion.


After the firsthard freeze of fall, gardens are sadly lit tered with the detrit us of the summer's plant s and produce: stalks, leaves, vines, rot ted vegetables, and maybe even a hand trowel left behind. As the flooding Mississippi River retreat s back to it s ordinary course, it leaves detrit us behind in it s wake, debris gathered from everywhere by the raging waters. The detrit us of civilization may include junkyards and abandoned buildings; mental detrit us may includes all kinds of useless trivia. Notice how this word is pronounced; for some reason, people often try to accent the first syllable rather than the second.
 
hoi polloi                           The general population; the masses.


E.g.
 He's a terrible snob, the kind of person who thinks it 's funny to say things like "the riffraff" and "the hoi polloi" and "the great unwashed."


In Greek, hoi polloi means simply "the many." (Even though hoi it self means "the," in English we almostalways say "the hoi polloi.") It comes originally from the famous Funeral Oration by Pericles, where it was actually used in a positive way. Today it 's generally used by people who  think of themselves as superior-though it 's also sometimes used in Pericles' democratic spirit . By the way, ithas no relation to hoity-toity, meaning "st uck-up," which start s with the same sound buthas nothing to do with Greek.
 
kudos                      (1) Fame and renown thatresult from an achievement ; prestige. (2) Praise.


E.g.
 His first film earned him kudos at the independent film festivals, and the big st udios were soon calling him up.


Kudos is an odd word in English. In Greek, kydos meant "glory" or "prestige"; in other words, it wasn't something you could count . Butin English kudos looks like a plural and is therefore often treated as one. So people now sometimes use the form kudo, with kudos as it s plural.
 
onus                  A disagreeable necessity or obligation; responsibility.


E.g.
 Now that Congress has passed the bill, the onus is on the President to live up to his promise and sign itinto law.


In Latin onus means literally a "burden," like a particularly heavy backpack. Butin English an onus is more often a burden of responsibility or blame. In legal language, the onus probandi is the "burden of proof," meaning the big job of assembling enough evidence to prove a person's guilt , since the accused is innocent until proved guilty.
 
stigma                      A mark of shame: stain.


E.g.
 In these small villages, the stigma of pregnancy is a terrible thing for an unmarried girl.


In Greek and Latin, a stigma was a mark or brand, especially one that marked a slave, so a stigma marked a person as inferior. When the plural form stigmata is used, it usually refers to the nail wounds on Christ 's hands and feet , wounds which have sometimes reappeared on the hands or feet of later worshippers such as St . Francis. When stigma began to be used in English, it usually meant the kind of mark or stain you can'tactually see. So t oday we hear about the stigma of homelessness, the stigma of overweight , and the stigma of mental illness. People may be so afraid of being stigmatized for losing a job that they'll put on their office clothes and drive out their driveways every weekday morning so that the neighbors won't know.

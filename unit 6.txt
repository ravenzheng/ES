EQU comes from the Latin word aequus, meaning "equal." To equalize means to make things equal. Things thatare equivalenthave the same value, use, or meaning. All three sides of an equilateral triangle are of the same length. And an equation (for instance, 21 + 47 = 68) is a statement that two mathematical expressions are equal.
 
equable                     (1) Tending to remain calm. (2) Free from harsh changes or extreme variation.


E.g.
 Her friends thoughtit odd that such an equable woman had married a man so moody and unpredictable.


Equable usually describes either climate or personality. The word seems to be used less t oday than in decades past , maybe because the personality type is less admired than it used to be. A steady, calm, equable personality may not produce much excitement but usually makes for a good worker and a good parent , and maybe even a longer life. In the words of the poetrobert Service: "Avoid extremes: be moderate / In saving and in spending. / An equable and easy gait / Will win an easy ending."
 
adequacy
   Being equal to some need or requirement .


E.g.
 Environmentalist s doubt the adequacy of these regulations to protect the wilderness areas.


When we question the adequacy of health-care coverage, or parking facilities, or school funding, we're asking if they are equal to our need. The adjective adequate means "enough" or "acceptable"-though in sentences like "His performance was adequate," itreally means "no bet ter than acceptable."
 
equilibrium
  (1) A state in which opposing forces are balanced so that one is not stronger or greater than the other. (2) A state of emotional balance or calmness.


E.g.
 The news had come as a shock, and it t ook him several minutes to recover his equilibrium.


Equilibrium contains a root from the  Latin libra,  meaning  "weight "  or  "balance."  As  a constellation, zodiac symbol, and astrological sign, Libra is usually pictured as a set of balance scales, often held by the blindfolded goddess of justice, which symbolizes fairness, equality, and justice. Equilibrium has special meanings in biology, chemistry, physics, and economics, butin all of them itrefers to the balance of competing influences.
 
equinox
    A day when day and nightare the same length.


E.g.
 She and her friends got t ogether for an equinox party t wice a year to celebrate the arrival of the fall and the spring.


If you know that nox means "night " in Latin, it 's nothard to remember the meaning of equinox. There are two equinoxes in the year: the spring equinox, around March 21, and the fall equinox, around September 23. The equinoxes are  contrasted  with  the solstices, when the sun is farthest north and south of the equat or. The summer solstice occurs around June 22 (the longest day of the year), the winter solstice around December 22 (the shortest day).
 
QUIS is derived from the Latin verb meaning "to seek or obtain." The root s quer, quir, and ques
are derived from the same Latin verb and give us words such as inquiry and question.
 
inquisition
    A questioning or examining thatis often harsh or severe.


E.g.
 The President 's firstchoice for the job turned him down, fearing the Senate hearings would turn into an inquisition into her past .


While an inquiry can be almostany search for truth, the related word inquisition suggest s a long, thorough investigation thatinvolves extensive and harsh questioning. Though the two words originally had about the same meaning, t oday inquisition tends to remind us of the Spanish Inquisition, an ongoing trial conducted by church-appointed inquisitors that began in the Middle Ages and sought out nonbelievers, Jews, and Muslims, thousands of whom were sentenced to t orture and to burning at the stake.
 
perquisite                       (1) A privilege or profit thatis provided in addition to one's base salary. (2) Something claimed as an exclusive possession or right .


E.g.
 A new car, a big house, and yearly trips to Europe were among the perquisites that made the presidency of Wyndam College such an at tractive position.


Though the Latin source of perquisite originally meant "something insistent ly asked for," the "ask" meaning has most ly vanished from the English word. A perquisite, often called simply a perk, is instead something of value that the holder of a particular job or position is entit led t o, usually withouteven asking. The President of the United States, for instance, enjoys  as perquisites the use of Camp David and Air Force One. Perhaps because perquisites are usually available to only a small number of people, the word sometimes refers to non-job-related privileges thatare claimed as exclusive right s.
 
acquisitive
  Eager to acquire; greedy.


E.g.
 With each year the couple became more madly acquisitive, buying jewelry, a huge yacht , and two country estates.


Unlike most tribal peoples and the populations of some older countries, we Americans live in an acquisitive society, a society devoted to get ting and spending. And America often makes successfully acquisitive people into heroes; even Ebenezer Scrooge, that model of miserly greed and acquisitiveness, was once defended by a White House chief of staff. An acquisitive nation may seek to acquire other territ ories by force. But mental acquisition of specialized knowledge or skills-or new vocabulary!-doesn't deprive others of the same information.
 
requisition
    A demand or request  (such as for supplies) made with proper authority.


E.g.
 The teachers had grown impatient with having to submita requisition for even routine classroom supplies.


Requisition was originally a noun butis now probably more common as a verb. So we either can speak of sending our office's purchasing depart menta requisition for computers, or of requisitioning more computers from the depart ment . The word has an official sound to it . However, one of Hollywood's bit tersweet love st ories begins when Omar Sharif, playing a World War I freedom fighter, says to Ingrid Bergman, who is the owner of a stately old yellow Rolls Royce, "I've come to requisition your car."
 

 
PLE/PLEN comes from a Latin word meaning "to fill."  It  can be seen in the words plenty, meaning basically "filled," and complete, meaning "thoroughly filled."
 
plenary                          (1) Including all who have a right to at tend. (2) Complete in all ways.


E.g.
 For the convention's plenary session, five thousand members gathered to hear a star speaker.


Plenary often shows up in writing referring to the "plenary power" held by a government , and is particularly used for powers mentioned in a constit ution.  For  example,  under  the  U.S. Constit ution, the Congress has plenary power to wage war, which means that no one else- not the court s, not the states, not the president -has any power what soever to second-guess Congress about warmaking. But  in recent  years, that  hasn't  st opped some president s from starting conflict s that looked a lot like wars to most people. Ata conference, the plenary sessions (unlike the various smaller "presentations,"  "workshops,"  "forums,"  and "seminars" that otherwise fill the day) try to bring everyone t ogether in the same room.
 
complement
(1) Something that fills up or makes perfect ; the amount needed to make something complete. (2) A counterpart .


E.g.
 On the commit tee, the two young people provided an energetic complement to the older members.


A complement fills out or balances something. We think of saltas the complement of pepper (maybe most ly because of their colors), and the right necktie is a perfect complement to a good suit . Complement can also mean "the full quantity, number, or amount "; thus, a ship's complement of officers and crew is the whole force necessary for full operation. Complementis actually most common as a verb; we may say, for example, thata bright blue scarf complements a cream-colored out fit beautifully. Don't confuse complement with compliment, which means an expression of respect or affection.
 
deplete                   To reduce in amount by using up.


E.g.
 Years of farming on the same small plot of land had left the soil depleted of minerals.


The de- prefix often means "do the opposite of," so deplete means the opposite of "fill." Thus, for example, a kitchen's food supplies can be rapidly depleted by hungry  teenagers. But deplete often suggest s something more serious. Desertions can deplete an army; layoffs can deplete an office staff; and t oo much time in bed can rapidly deplete your muscular strength.
 
replete                  Fully or abundant ly filled or supplied.


E.g.
 The professor's aut obiography was replete with scandalous anecdotes about campus life in the 1950s.


Replete implies that something is filled almost to capacity. Aut umn landscapes in New England are replete with colorful foliage. Supermarket tabloids are always replete with details of stars' lives, whether real or imaginary. And a professor may complain that most of the papers she received were replete with errors in grammar and punctuation.
 
METR/METER comes to us from Greek by way of Latin; in both languages itrefers to "measure." A thermometer measures heat ; a perimeter is the measure around something; and things thatare isometric are equal in measure.
 
metric                 (1) Relating to or based on the metric system. (2) Relating to or arranged in meter.


E.g.
 Americans have resisted using the metric system for years, butare now slowly get ting accust omed to a few of the metric unit s.


The metric system was invented in France in the years following the French Revolution, and a version of itis now used in most of the world to measure distance, weight , and volume. Basic metric unit s include the kilogram (the basic unit of weight ), the liter (the basic unit of volume), and of course the meter (the basic unit of length-see below). Metric-or more often metrical- can also refer to the basic underlying rhythm of songs and poetry. So while the scientist s' measurement s are usually metric, the poet s' are usually metrical.
 
meter                 (1) The basic metric unit  of length, equal to about  39.37 inches. (2) A systematic rhythm in poetry or music.


E.g.
 The basic meter of the piece was 3/4, butit s rhythms were so complicated that the 3/4 was sometimes hard to hear.


Meter is a metric measurement slight ly longer than a yard; thus, a 100-meter dash might take you a second longer than a 100-yard dash. But the word has a different sense in music, where people aren't separated by whether they use the metric system. For a musician, the meter is the regular background rhythm, expressed by the "time signature" writ ten at the beginning of a piece or section: 2/2, 2/4, 3/8, 4/4, 6/8, et c. Within a meter, you can create rhythms thatrange from the simple to the complex. So, for example, "America the Beautiful" is in 4/4 meter (or "4/4 time"), but so are most of the rhythmically complex songs writ ten by Paul Simon, Burt Bacharach, or Stevie Wonder. In ordinary conversation, though, most people use "rhythm" to include meter and everything that 's built on t op of it . In poetry, meter has much the same meaning; however, poetic meters aren't named with numbers butinstead with  traditional Greek and Latin terms such as iambic and dactylic.
 
odometer
    An instrument used to measure distance traveled.


E.g.
 Jennifer watched the odometer to see how far she would have to drive to her new job.


Odometer includes the root from the Greek word hodos, meaning "road" or "trip." An odometer shares space on your dashboard with a speedometer, a tachometer, and maybe a "tripmeter." The odometer is what crooked car salesmen tamper with when they want to reduce the mileage a car registers as having traveled. One of life's lit t le pleasures  is  watching  the odometer as all the numbers change at the same time.
 
tachometer
     A device used to measure speed of rotation.


E.g.
 Even though one purpose of a tachometer is to help drivers keep their engine speeds down, some of us occasionally try to see how high we can make the needle go.


A tachometer is literally a "speed-measurer," since the Greek root tach- means "speed." This is clear in the names of the tachyon, a particle of mat ter that travels faster than the speed of light (if itactually exist s, it 's so fast thatit 's impossible to see with any instrument ), and tachycardia, a medical condition in which the heartraces uncontrollably. Since the speed thatan auto tachometer measures is speed of rotation of the crankshaft , the numbers itreport s are revolutions per minute, or rpm's.
 

 
AUD, from the Latin verb audire, is the root thathas to do with hearing. Whatis audible can be heard. An audience is a group of listeners, sometimes seated in an auditorium.  And audio t oday can mean almostanything thathas to do with sound.
 
audit or                        A person who formally examines and verifies financial account s.


E.g.
 It seems impossible that so many banks could have got ten into so much trouble if their audit ors had been doing their jobs.


The auditing of a company's financial records by independentexaminers on a regular basis is necessary to prevent "cooking the books," and thus to keep the company honest . We don't normally think of audit ors as listening, since looking atand adding up numbers is their basic line of work, butaudit ors do have to listen to people's  explanations, and  perhaps  that 's  the hist orical link. Hearing is more obviously part of another meaning of audit, the kind that college st udent s do when they sitin on a class without taking exams or receiving an official grade.
 
audit ory
  (1) Perceived or experienced through hearing. (2) Of or relating to the sense or organs of hearing.


E.g.
 With the "surround-sound" systems in most theaters, going to a movie is now an audit ory experience as much as a visual one.


Auditory is close in meaning to acoustic and acoustical, butauditory usually refers more to hearing than to sound. For instance, many dogs have greataudit ory (notacoustic) powers, and th e auditory nerve let s us hear by connecting the inner ear to the brain. Acoustic and acoustical instead refer especially to instrument s and the conditions under which sound can be heard; so architect s concern themselves with the acoustic properties of an audit orium, and instrument makers with those of a clarinet or piano.
 
audition                          A trial performance to evaluate a performer's skills.


E.g.
 Auditions for Broadway shows at tract so many hopeful unknown performers thateveryone in the business calls them "cat t le calls."


Most stars are discovered atauditions, where a number of candidates read the same partand the direct or chooses. Lana Turner famously skipped the audition process and was instead discovered by an agent sipping a soda in a Sunset Boulevard caf¨¦ atage 16. Audition can also be a verb; so, for example, after Miss Turner gained her stardom, act ors had to audition to be her leading man. But when musicians audition for a job in an orchestra, it 's usually behind a screen so that the judges won'teven know their sex and therefore can't do anything but listen.
 
inaudible
 Notheard or capable of being heard.


E.g.
 The coach spoke to her in a low voice that was inaudible to the rest of the gymnastics team.


With it s negative prefix in-, inaudible means the opposite of audible. What 's clearly audible to you may be inaudible to your elderly grandfather. Modern spy technology can turn inaudible conversations into audible ones with the use of high-powered directional microphones, so if you think you're being spied on, make sure there's a lot of other noise around you. And if you don't wanteveryone around you to know you're bored, keep your sighs inaudible.
 
SON is the Latin root meaning "sound." Sonata, meaning a piece for one or two instrument s, was originally an Italian verb meaning "sounded" (when singers were involved, the Italians used a different verb). And sonorous means full, loud, or rich in sound.
 
sonic          (1) Having to do with sound. (2) Having to do with the speed of sound in air (about 750 miles per hour).


E.g.
 A sonic depth finder can easily determine the depth of a lake by bouncing a sound signal off the bot t om.


A sonic boom is an explosive sound created by a shock wave formed at the nose of an aircraft . In 1947 a plane piloted by Chuck Yeager burst the "sound barrier" and created the first sonic boom. In the decades afterward sonic booms became a familiar sound to Americans. (Because of steps that were eventually taken, sonic booms are rarely heard anymore.) Today sonic is often used by ambitious rock musicians to describe their experimental sounds.
 
dissonant           (1) Clashing or discordant , especially in music. (2) Incompatible or disagreeing.


E.g.
 Critics of the health-care plan  pointed to it s  two seemingly  dissonant  goals:  cost containment , which would try to control spending, and universal coverage, which could increase spending.


Since dissonantincludes the negative prefix dis-, whatis dissonant sounds or feels unresolved, unharmonic, and clashing. Early in the 20th century, composers such as Arnold Schoenberg and his st udent s developed the use of dissonance in music as a style in it self. But to many listeners, the sounds in such music are still unbearable, and most continue to prefer music based on traditional t onality. Dissonantis now often used withoutreferring to sound atall. Cognitive dissonance, for example, is whathappens when you believe two different things that can'tactually both be true.
 
resonance
  (1) A continuing or echoing of sound. (2) A richness and variety in the depth and quality of sound.


E.g.
 The resonance of James Earl Jones's vocal t ones in such roles as Darth Vader made his voice one of the mostrecognizable of it s time.


Many of the finest musical instrument s possess a high degree of resonance which, by producing additional vibrations and echoes of  the original sound, enriches and amplifies it . Violins made by the Italian masters Stradivari and Guarneri possess a quality of resonance that later violinmakers have never precisely duplicated. And you may have noticed how a particular note will start something in a room buzzing, as one of the t ouching surfaces begins to resonate with the note. Because of that , resonance and resonate-along with the adjective resonant-aren'talways used to describe sound. For example, you may say thata novel resonates strongly with you because the author seems to be describing your own experiences and feelings.
 
ultrasonic                         Having a frequency higher than what  can be heard by the human ear.


E.g.
 My grandfather's dog is always pricking up it s ears at some ultrasonic signal, while he himself is so deaf he can'teven hear a bird singing.


Ultrasound, or ultrasonography, works on the principle that sound is reflected at different speeds by tissues or substances of different densities. Ultrasound technology has been used medically since the 1940s. Sonograms, the pictures produced by ultrasound, can reveal heart defect s, t umors, and gallst ones; since low-power ultrasonic waves don't presentany risks to a body, they're most  often used to display fet uses during pregnancy in order to make sure they're healthy. Ultrasonics has many other uses, including underwater sonar sensing. High- power ultrasonics are so intense that they're actually used for drilling and welding.
 

 
ERR, from the Latin verb errare, means "to wander" or "to stray." The rootis seen in the word error, meaning a wandering or straying from whatis correct or true. Erratum (plural, errata) is Latin for "mistake"; so an errata page is a book page that  list s mistakes found t oo late to correct before the book's publication.
 
errant          (1)  Wandering  or  moving  about  aimlessly. (2)  Straying  out side  proper bounds, or away from an accepted pat tern or standard.


E.g.
 Modern-day cowboys have been known to use helicopters to spoterrant calves.


Errant means both "wandering" and "mistaken." A knight-errant was a wandering knight who wentabout slaying dragons or rescuing damsels in distress (at least when he was on good behavior). Arrantis a old-fashioned spelling of errant; an arrant knave (the phrase comes from Shakespeare) is an extremely untrust worthy individual. An errant sock might be one that 's got ten lost ; an errant politician might be one who's been caughtcheating; and an errant cloud might be one that float s by all alone in a deep-blue sky on a summer day.
 
aberrant                          Straying or differing from the right , normal, or natural type.


E.g.
 Sullivan's increasingly  aberrant  behavior  was  leading  his  friends to question  his  mental stability.


Something aberranthas wandered away from the usual path or form. The word is generally used in a negative way; aberrant behavior, for example, may be a sympt om of other problems. But the discovery of an aberrant variety of a species can be exciting news to a biologist , and identifying an aberrant gene has led the way to new treat ment s for diseases.
 
erratic                   (1) Having no fixed course. (2) Lacking in consistency.


E.g.
 In the 1993 World Series, the Phillies weren'thelped by the erratic performance of their ace relief pitcher, "Wild Thing."


Erratic can refer to literal "wandering." A missile that loses it s guidance system may follow an erratic path, and a river with lot s of t wist s and bends is said to have an erratic course. Erratic can also mean "inconsistent " or "irregular." So a st ock market that often changes direction is said to be acting erratically; an erratic heart beat can be cause for concern; and if your car idles erratically it may mean that something's wrong with the spark-plug wiring.
 
erroneous                           Mistaken, incorrect .


E.g.
 For years her parent s had had an erroneous idea of her intelligence, because she didn't begin to talk until the age of six.


Erroneous basically means "containing errors," and, since most of us are constant ly suffering from mistaken notions, the word is often used in front of words such as "assumption" and "idea." It 's also used to describe the kind of mistaken information that can lead to erroneous theories, erroneous conclusions, and erroneous decisions.
 
CED comes from the Latin verb cedere, meaning "to proceed" or "to yield." Proceed it self employs the root , as does recede, and their related nouns procession and recession employ another form of the Latin verb.
 
cede              To give up, especially by treaty; yield.


E.g.
 Their 88-year-old father reluctant ly ceded control over his finances to two of the children this year.


Cede is often a formal term used in discussing territ ory and right s, butis also used less formally. So, for example, Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the U.S. in 1898, following the Spanish- American War, and the U.S. ceded control of the Panama Canal to Panama in 1999. Critics warn that we are ceding leadership in alternative-energy technology to China. Citizens of one European country or another are always worrying that their own country is ceding t oo much power to the European Union. A tennis player doesn'thave any choice when she cedes her no. 1 ranking to a rival.
 
concede                       To admit grudgingly; yield.


E.g.
 To his friends, Senat or Beasley concedes thathis reelection campaign was badly run and thathe made several damaging errors.


After the votes have been counted, one candidate traditionally concedes the election to his or her opponent by giving a concession speech. If you're lucky, your boss will concede that she was wrong the last time she criticized you. Butin the middle of an argument , we're notall so good at conceding that the other guy mighthave a good point .
 
accede                     (1) To give in to a request or demand. (2) To give approval or consent .


E.g.
 This time Congress refused to accede to the demands of the president , and began cut ting the funding for the war.


To accede usually means to yield, often under pressure and with some reluctance, to the needs or request s of others. Voters usually accede to a tax increase only when they're convinced it 's the only real solution to a short fall in government funding. A patient may accede to surgery only after the doct or assures him it 's bet ter than the alternatives. If you accede to your spouse's plea to watch the new reality show at 9:00, you may get to choose something bet ter at 10:00.
 
precedent
  Something done or said that may be an example or rule to guide later act s of a similar kind.


E.g.
 When Judy bought Christ mas present s for all her relatives one year, she claimed thatit set no precedent , butit did.


A precedentis something that precedes, or comes before. The Supreme Courtrelies on precedent s-thatis, earlier laws or decisions that provide some example or rule to guide them in the case they're actually deciding. When hostages are being held for ransom, a government may worry about set ting a bad precedentif it gives in. And a company might "break with precedent " by naming a foreigner as it s president for the first time.
 

 
Words from Mythology and History

Augean stable
  A condition or place marked by greataccumulation of filth or corruption.


E.g.
 Leaders of many of the newly formed nations of Eastern Europe found that the old government s of their countries had become Augean stables that they must now clean out .


Augeus, the mythical king of Elis, kept great stables thatheld 3,000 oxen and had not been cleaned for thirty years when Hercules was assigned the job as one of his famous "t welve labors." This task was enormous even for someone so mighty, so Hercules shifted the course of two rivers to make them pour through the stables. Augean by it self has come to mean "extremely difficult or distasteful", and to "clean the Augean stable" usually means either to clear away corruption or to perform a large and unpleasant task that  has long called for at tention. So t oday we refer to "Augean tasks," "Augean labor," or even "Augean clut ter." And  the British firm Augean PLC is-whatelseE.g.
-a waste-management company.
 
Croesus                      A very rich person.


E.g.
 Warren Buffet t 's extraordinary record of acquiring  and investing  made him an American Croesus.


Croesus, which tends to appear in the phrase "rich as Croesus," was the name of a king of Lydia, an ancient kingdom in whatis now western Turkey, who died around 546 B.C. Lydia was probably the first country in hist ory to use coins, and under the wealthy and powerful Croesus the first coins of pure silver and gold were produced, which may have added to the legends surrounding his wealth. Butit was Croesus who the Greek lawgiver Solon was thinking about when he said "Count no man happy  until  his  death"-and  indeed  Croesus  was  finally overthrown and may even have been burned alive.
 
dragon's teeth
 Seeds of conflict .


E.g.
 Many expert s believed that , in invading a Middle Eastern country thathadn'tat tacked us, we were sowing dragon's teeth.


The Phoenician prince Cadmus once killed a dragon, and was instructed by the goddess Athena to plantit s teeth in the ground. From the many teeth, there immediately sprang up an army of fierce armed men. The goddess then directed him to throw a precious st one into their midst , and they proceeded to slaughter each other until only the five greatest warriors were left ; these became Cadmus's generals, with whom he constructed the great city-state of Thebes. When we "sow dragon's teeth," we're creating the conditions for future trouble.
 
Hades                     The underground home of the dead in Greek mythology.


E.g.
 In a dramatic scene, he crawls up out of the ground coated in black petroleum as though emerging from Hades.


In Greek mythology, Hades is both the land of the dead and the god who rules there. Hades the god (who the Greeks also called Plut o) is the brother of Zeus and Poseidon, who rule the skies and the seas. The realm called Hades, where he rules with his wife Persephone, is the region under the earth, full of mineral wealth and fertility and home to dead souls. Hades t oday is sometimes used as a polite term for Hell ("It 's hot ter than Hades in here!").
 
lethargic                          (1) Lazily sluggish. (2) Indifferent or apathetic.


E.g.
 Once again the long Sunday dinner had left most of the family feeling st uffed and lethargic.


The philosopher Plato wrote that before a dead person could leave the underworld to begin a new life, he or she had to drink from the river Lethe, whose name means "forget fulness" in Greek, and forgetall aspect s of one's former life and the time spentin Hades (usually pret ty awful, according to Plat o). But lethargic and it s noun lethargy never actually refer to forget ting; instead, they describe the weak, ghost ly state of the dead spirit s-so weak that they may require a drink of blood before they can even speak.
 
Midas t ouch
     The talent for making money in every venture.


E.g.
 Invest ors are always looking for an invest mentadviser with the Midas t ouch, butafter a couple of good years each adviser's brilliance usually seems to vanish.


Midas was a legendary king of Phrygia (in modern-day Turkey). In return for a good deed, he was granted one wish by the god Dionysus, and asked for the power to turn everything he t ouched into gold. When he discovered to his horror thathis t ouch had turned his food and drink-and even his daughter-to gold, he begged Dionysus to take back the gift , and Dionysus agreed to do so. When "Midas t ouch" is used t oday, the moral of this tale of greed is usually ignored.
 
Pyrrhic vict ory
 A vict ory won atexcessive cost .


E.g.
 That win turned out to be a Pyrrhic vict ory, since our best players sustained injuries that would sideline them for weeks.


In 279 B.C. Pyrrhus, the king of Epirus, a country in northwest Greece, defeated the Romans at the Bat t le of Ausculum, but lostall of his best officers and many men. He is said to have exclaimed after the bat t le, "One more such vict ory and we are lost ." Pyrrhic vict ories are more common than we tend to think. Whenever we win an argument butin so doing manage to offend the friend we were arguing with, or whenever a country invades another country butrouses widespread opposition in surrounding countries in the process, it 's probably a Pyrrhic vict ory thathas been achieved.
 
stygian                       Extremely dark, dank, gloomy, and forbidding.


E.g.
 When the power went outin the building, the halls and stairwells were plunged in stygian darkness.


The Greek underworld of Hades was cold and dark, rather than blazing like the Christian image of Hell. The river Styx, whose name meant "hateful" in Greek, was the chief river of the underground, and the souls of the dead were ferried across it s poisonous waters into Hades by the boat man Charon. The Styx was so terrible thateven the gods swore by it s name in their most solemn oaths. The name Stygia, borrowed from stygian, is used for a country in fantasy games t oday; buta stygian at mosphere, a stygian t unnel, stygian darkness, and so on, still describe the dreary cheerlessness of the Greek underworld.

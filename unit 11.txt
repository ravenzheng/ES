CANT, from the Latin verb cantare, meaning "sing," produces several words that come direct ly from Latin. But some others came to English by way of French, which added an h to the root , giving us such words as chantand chantey.
 
cantata                        A musical composition, particularly a religious work from the 17th or 18th century, for one or more voices accompanied by instrument s.


E.g.
 Composers of the 18th century composed sacred cantatas by the dozen, and Bach's friend
G. P. Telemann actually wrote over a thousand.


A cantata is sung, unlike a sonata, which is played on instrument s only. The most famous cantatas are by Johann Sebastian Bach, who wrote the music for about 200 religious cantatas, using hymns and new religious poems as his text s. His cantatas consisted of several different sections for different  voices-solos, duet s, and choruses. Some of his nonreligious cantatas have been performed like mini-operas.
 
incantation
 (1) A use of spells or verbal charms spoken or sung as part of a ritual of magic. (2) A formula of words used in, or as if in, such a ritual.


E.g.
 He repeated the words slowly over and over like an incantation.


Incantation comes direct ly from the Latin word incantare, "enchant ." Incantare it self has cantare as a root , which reminds us that magic and ritual have always been associated with chanting and music. Incantations have often been in strange languages; "Abracadabra" is a not -so-serious version of an incantation.
 
cant or           An official of a Jewish synagogue who sings or chant s the music of the services and leads the congregation in prayer.


E.g.
 The congregation waited for the cant or to begin the prayers before joining in.


The cant or is, after the rabbi, the mostimportant figure in a Jewish worship service. A cant or not only must possess an excellent singing voice butalso must know by heart long passages of Hebrew. Cant ors such as Jan Peerce and Richard Tucker became international opera stars. The comedian and singer Edward Israel Iskowit z renamed himself Eddie Cant or for his original profession and became enormously popular on stage, screen, radio, and television for over 40 years.
 
descant                           An additional melody sung above the principal melody.


E.g.
 The soprano added a soaring descant to the final chorus thatheld the listeners spellbound.


The prefix des-, meaning "t wo" or "apart ," indicates that the descantis a "second song" apart from the main melody. In popular songs a descant will often be sung at the very end to produce a thrilling climax.
 
LINGU comes from the Latin word that means both "t ongue" and "language," and in English t oday tongue can still mean "language" (as in "her native t ongue"). Our expression "slip of the t ongue" is justa translation of the Latin phrase lapsus linguae. The rooteven shows up in a slangy-sounding word like lingo. And since lingu- changed to langu- in French, our word language is related as well.
 
linguistics
    The st udy of human speech.


E.g.
 The new speechwriter, who had majored in linguistics, was soon put ting his knowledge of the deceptive tricks of language to good use.


Any analysis of language, including 8th-grade grammar, can be called linguistics. As recent ly as 200 years ago, ordinary grammar was about the only kind of linguistics there was. Today a linguist may be a person who learns foreign languages, but the term usually refers to people who devote themselves to analyzing the structure of language. Many linguist s concentrate on the hist ory of a language; others st udy the way children learn to speak; others analyze the sounds of a language-and still others just st udy English grammar, a subject so big thatyou could easily spend your entire life on it .
 
multilingual
  Using or able to use several languages.


E.g.
 She soon discovered thathe was truly multilingual, fluentin not only the German and Polish he had grown up speaking butin English and Arabic as well.


The root s of multilingual come from Latin (see MULTI). If you happen to prefer Greek, use the synonym polyglot, in which poly- has the same meaning as multi-, and -glot means the same thing  as -lingual. The best  way to become multilingual is probably to be born in a bilingual (t wo-language) household; learning those first two seems to give the mind the kind of exercise that makes later language-learning easy.
 
lingua franca
   A language used as a common or commercial language among peoples who speak different languages.


E.g.
 That firstevening in Tokyo, she heard English being spoken at the next table, and realized it was serving as a lingua franca for a party of Korean and Japanese businessmen.


In the Middle Ages, the Arabs of  the eastern Mediterranean referred to all Europeans as Franks (the name of the tribe that once occupied the land we call France). Since there was plenty of Arab-European trade, the traders in the Mediterranean port s eventually developed a  trading language combining Italian, Arabic, and other languages, which almosteveryone could more or less understand, and it became known as the "Frankish language," or lingua franca. Some languages actually succeed in becoming lingua francas withoutchanging much. So, when the Roman empire became vastand mighty, Latin became the important lingua franca; and ata meeting bet ween Japanese and Viet namese businesspeople t oday, English may well be the only language spoken.
 
linguine
 A narrow, flat pasta.


E.g.
 As a test of her client s' table manners, she would serve them challenging dishes and watch to see how gracefully they could handle chopsticks or deal with long, slithery linguine.


The modern language closest to Latin is Italian, and the Italian word linguine means literally "lit t le t ongues." Linguine is only one of the types of pasta whose names describes their shapes. Others include spaghetti ("lit t le strings"), fettuccine ("lit t le ribbons"), penne ("lit t le quills"), orzo ("barley"), farfalle ("but terflies"), vermicelli ("lit t le worms"), capellini ("lit t le hairs"), fusilli ("lit t le spindles"), and radiatori ("lit t le radiat ors"). If you're thinking about learning Italian, you could make a good start by just visiting an Italian restaurant .
 

 
SPIR comes from the Latin words meaning "breath" and "breathe." When we inspire others- thatis, give them inspiration-it 's as though we're breathing new energy and imagination into them. When you expire, or die, you "breathe out "  your soul in your last breath. A license, membership, credit card, or free offer may also expire, ata time indicated by it s expiration date.
 
spirited                           Full of energy or courage; very lively or determined.


E.g.
 The team put up a spirited defense, but they were doomed from the start .


You may see spirited used to describe a conversation, a debate, a horse, or a campaign. And it often shows up in such words as high-spirited ("bold and energetic"), mean-spirited ("spiteful"), and public-spirited ("generous to a community"), all of which reflect the original meaning of spirit, a notion much like "soul" or "personality."
 
dispiriting
  Causing a loss of hope or enthusiasm.


E.g.
 It was terribly dispiriting for them to lose yetanother game, and he had to reassure his daughter that she'd actually done a great job as goalie.


Lot s of things can be dispiriting: a bad job interview, an awful film, a relationship going sour. Maybe for thatreason, dispiriting has lot s of synonyms: discouraging, disheartening, demoralizing, depressing, et c.
 
respirat or                    (1) A device  worn  over the  nose  and  mouth to filter out dangerous substances from the air. (2) A device for maintaining artificial respiration.


E.g.
 His lungs had been terribly damaged by decades of heavy smoking, and he'd been living on a respirat or for the lastyear.


Respiration means simply "breathing." We usually come across the word in artificial respiration, the lifesaving technique in which you force air into the lungs of someone who's st opped breathing. Respirat ors can take several different forms. Scuba-diving equipmentalways includes a respirat or, though it doesn'tactually do the breathing for  the  diver. Medical respirat ors, which are used especially for babies and for emergency care and actually take over the job of get ting oxygen  into  the  lungs, are  t oday  usually  called  ventilat ors, so  as to distinguish them from simple oxygen systems (which merely provide a steady flow of oxygen into the nostrils) and face masks.
 
transpire                        (1) To happen. (2) To become known.


E.g.
 We kept up our questioning, and it soon transpired that the boys had known about the murder all along .


Since the prefix trans- means "through" (see TRANS) , transpire's most literal  meaning  is something like "breathe through." Thus, the original meaning of the English word-still used t oday-is to give off a watery vapor through a surface such as a leaf. From there, it came to mean also the gradual appearance of previously secretinformation, as if leaking out  of the pores of a leaf (as in "It transpired that she was not only his employee butalso his girlfriend"). And soon it was being used to mean simply "happen" (as in "I wondered whathad transpired in the cafeteria at lunchtime").
 
VER comes from the Latin word for "truth." A verdictin a trial is "the truth spoken" (see DICT). Buta just verdict may depend on the veracity, or "truthfulness," of the wit nesses.
 
verify                      (1) To prove to be true or correct . (2) To check or test the accuracy of.


E.g.
 Itis the bank teller's job to verify the signature on a check.


During talks bet ween the United States and the former Soviet Union on nuclear weapons reduction, one big problem was how to verify that weapons had been eliminated. Since neither side wanted the other to know it s secret s, verification of the fact s became a difficultissue. Because of the distrust on both sides, many doubted that the real numbers would ever be verifiable.
 
aver                 To state positively as true; declare.


E.g.
 The defendantaverred that she was nowhere near the scene of the crime on the nightin question.


Since aver contains the "truth" root , it basically  means  "confirm  as  true."  You  may  aver anything thatyou're sure of. In legal situations, aver means to state positively as a fact ; thus, Perry Mason's client s aver that they are innocent , while the district  at t orney  avers  the opposite. If you make such a statement while under oath, and it turns out thatyou lied, you may have commit ted the crime of perjury.
 
verisimilit ude
        (1) The appearance of being true or probable. (2) The depiction of realism in art or literature.


E.g.
 By the beginning of the 20th century, the leading European painters were losing interestin verisimilit ude and beginning to experiment with abstraction.


From it s root s, verisimilitude means basically "similarity to the truth." Most fiction writers and filmmakers aim at some kind of verisimilit ude to give their st ories an air of reality. They need not show something actually true, or even very common, but simply something believable. A mass of good details in a play, novel, painting, or film may add verisimilit ude. A spy novel without some verisimilit ude won'tinterest many readers, buta fantastical novel may noteven at tempt to seem true to life.
 
veracity
  (1) Truth or accuracy. (2) The quality of being truthful or honest .


E.g.
 We haven't been able to check the veracity of most of his st ory, but we know he wasn'tat the motel that night .


People often claim thata frog placed in cold water that then is gradually heated will letit self be boiled to death, but the st ory actually lacks veracity. We often hear that the Eskimo (Inuit ) peoples have dozens of words for "snow," but the veracity of the statementis doubt ful, since Eskimo languages seem to have no more snow words than English (with flake,  blizzard, powder, drift, freezing rain, et c.). In 2009 millions accepted the veracity of the claim that , againstall the evidence, the elected president wasn'ta native-born American. Notall the "fact s" we accept without thinking are harmless.
 

 
TURB comes from the Latin verb turbare, "to throw into confusion or upset ," and the noun turba, "crowd" or "confusion." So a disturbance, for example, confuses and upset s normal order or routine.
 
turbid        (1)  Thick  or  murky, especially  with  churned-up  sediment . (2)  Unclear, confused, muddled.


E.g.
 The mood of the crowd was rest less and turbid, and any spark could have turned them into a mob.


The Colorado River in spring, swollen by melting snow from the high mountains, races through the Grand Canyon, turbid and churning. A chemical solution may be described as turbid rather than clear. And your emotions may be turbid as well, especially where love is involved: What did he mean by that glanceE.g.
 Why did she say it like that E.g.

 
perturb                       To upset , confuse, or disarrange.


E.g.
 News of  the new peace accord was enough to perturb some radical opponent s of  any set t lement s.


With it s per- prefix, perturb meant originally "thoroughly upset ," though t oday the word has lost most of it s intense edge. Perturb and perturbation are often used by scientist s, usually when speaking of a change in their data indicating that something has affected some normal process. When someone is referred to as imperturbable, it means he or she manages to remain calm through the most trying experiences.
 
turbine             A rotary engine with blades made to turn and generate power by a current of water, steam, or air under pressure.


E.g.
 The power plant used huge turbines powered by water going over the dam to generate electricity.


The oldestand simplest form of turbine is the waterwheel, which is made to rotate by water falling across it s blades and into bucket s suspended from them. Hero of Alexandria invented the  first  steam-driven  turbine  in  the  1st  century A.D., but  a  commercially practical steam turbine wasn't developed until 1884; steam turbines are now the main element s of electric power stations. Jetengines are gas turbines. A turbojetengine uses a turbine to compress the incoming air that feeds the engine before being ejected to push the plane forward; a turboprop engine uses it s exhaust to drive a turbine that spins a propeller. A wind turbine generates electricity by being turned by the wind; the largest now have vanes with a turning diameter of over 400 feet .
 
turbulent
  (1)  Stirred  up,  agitated.  (2)  Stirring  up  unrest ,  violence,  or disturbance.


E.g.
 The huge ocean liner Queen Elizabeth II was never much troubled by turbulent seas that mighthave sunk smaller boat s.


Some people lead turbulent lives, and some are constant ly in the grip of turbulentemotions. The late 1960s are remembered as turbulentyears of social revolution in America and Europe. Often the captain of an airplane will warn passengers to fasten their seat belt s because of upper-air turbulence, which can make for a bumpy ride. El NiE.g.
o, a seasonal current of warm water in the Pacific Ocean, may create turbulence in the winds across the United States, affecting pat terns of rainfall and temperature as well.
 
VOLU/VOLV comes from the Latin verb volvere, meaning "to roll, wind, turn around, or t wistaround." Thus, revolve simply means "turn in circles." And a volume was originally a scroll or roll of papyrus.
 
voluble                           Speaking readily and rapidly; talkative.


E.g.
 He proved to be a voluble informer who would tell st ories of bookies, smugglers, and hit men to the detectives for hours.


A voluble person has words "rolling" off his or her t ongue. In O. Henry's famous st ory "The Ransom of Red Chief," the kidnappers nab a boy who turns out to be so unbearably voluble that they can hardly wait to turn him loose again.
 
devolve                ((1) To pass (responsibility, power, et c.) from one person or group to another person or group ata lower level of authority. (2) To gradually go from an advanced state to a less advanced state.


E.g.
 Since 1998, considerable power has been devolving from the British governmentin London to the new Scot tish Parliamentin Edinburgh.


With it s de- prefix (see DE) , devolution implies moving backward. Once powers have been centralized in a unified government , giving any powers back-thatis, devolving the power-to a smaller governmental unit can seem to be reversing a natural development . In a somewhat similar way, a job thatyour boss doesn't want to do may devolve upon you. But devolve and devolution are also treated nowadays as the opposites of evolve and evolution. So we may also speak of moral devolution, such as occurred in Germany in the 1930s, when a country with an extraordinary culture became a brutal dictat orship. And parent s may watch their slacker teenager and wonder if devolution is occurring rightin front of their eyes.
 
evolution
   A process of change from a lower, simpler, or worse state to one thatis higher, more complex, or bet ter.


E.g.
 Thomas Jefferson and the other Founding Fathers believed that political evolution reached it s highest form in democracy.


Part of the humor of the old Flintstones cart oon show is thatit contradict s whatis known about biological evolution, since humans actually evolved long after dinosaurs were extinct . Evolution can also be used more broadly to refer to technology, society, and other human creations. For example, an idea may evolve, even in your own mind, as the months or years pass. And though many people don't believe thathuman beings truly become bet ter with the passing centuries, many will argue that our societies tend to evolve, producing more goods and providing more protection for more people.
 
convoluted
  (1)  Having  a  pat tern  of  curved  windings.  (2)  Involved, intricate.


E.g.
 After 10 minutes, Mr. Collins's strange st ory had become so convoluted that none of us could follow it .


Convolution originally meanta complex winding pat tern such as those visible on the surface of the brain. So a convoluted argument or a convoluted explanation is one that winds this way and that . An official document may have to wind it s way through a convoluted process and be stamped by eight people before being approved. Convoluted language makes many people suspicious; as a great philosopher once said, "Anything that can be said can be said clearly."
 

 
FAC comes from the Latin verb facere, meaning "to make or do." Thus, a fact was originally simply "something done." A benefactor is someone who does good. And to manufacture is to make, usually in a factory.
 
fact or                    Something that contributes to producing a result : ingredient .


E.g.
 The mostimportant fact or in the success of the treaty talks was the physical presence of the two president s.


In Latin factor means simply "doer." So in English a fact or is an "act or" or element or ingredientin some  situation  or quantity. Charm can be a fact or in someone's success, and lack of exercise can be a fact or in producing a poor physique. In math we use factor to mean a number that can be multiplied or divided to produce a given number (for example, 5 and 8 are fact ors of 40). And in biology a gene may be called a fact or, since genes are ingredient s in the t otal organism.
 
fact ot um
A person whose job involves doing many different kinds of work.


E.g.
 Over the years she had become the office fact ot um, who might be doing legal research one day and organizing the company picnic the next .


This odd word doesn't come from ancient Latin, butit was coined to look as if it did. The term Johannes factotum, meaning "Jack-of-all-trades," first shows up in writing in 1592 to describe none other than Shakespeare himself. The word gofer is similar to factotum buta bit less dignified. In other words, a fact ot um is an assistant , but one who may have taken over some fairly important functions.
 
facile                  (1) Easily accomplished. (2) Shallow, superficial.


E.g.
 The principal made a facile argument for the school's policy, but no one was convinced.


A facile suggestion doesn't deal with the issue in any depth, and a facile solution may be only temporarily effective. A facile writer is one who seems to write t oo quickly and easily, and a careful reader may discover that the writer hasn'treally said very much.
 
facilitate To  make  (something)  easier; to make  (something)  run  more smoothly.


E.g.
 Her uncle hadn'texact ly got ten her the job, buthe had certainly facilitated the process.


Facilitating is about get ting things done. Clever employees are quiet ly facilitating all kinds of useful activity  within  their organizations  all the  time. People  who  lead  therapy  groups  or workshops are often called facilitators, since their job isn't to teach or to order butrather to make  the  meetings  as  productive  as  possible. Even  businesses  now  use  facilitat ors  in meetings where they don't  want  any person's particular desires to out weigh anyone else's. Th e facilitation  of  a  rewarding  discussion  should  be  a  facilitat or's  only  goal.  Today,  in recognition of the many different  situations that  may call for a facilitat or, there is even an International Association of Facilitat ors.
 
LUM comes from the Latin noun lumen, meaning "light ." Thus, our word illuminate means "to supply with light " or "make clear," and illumination is light that shines on something.
 
lumen                     In physics, the standard unit for measuring the rate of the flow of light .


E.g.
 The lumen is a measure of the perceived power of light .


There are two common unit s for measuring light , the candela and the lumen. Both are recognized as standard international unit s, which also include the second (for time), the kilogram (for weight ), and the meter (for length). The candela is a measure of intensity; an ordinary candle gives off light with the intensity of about one candela. The lumen is a measure of "luminous flux"; a standard 100-wat t light bulb gives off 1500-1700 lumens. Luminous flux indicates how much lightis actually perceived by the human eye. Technologies vary in how efficient ly they turn electricity into light ; halogen light s produce about 12 lumens per wat t , ordinary incandescent light bulbs produce about 15 lumens per wat t , and compact fluorescent bulbs produce about 50 lumens per wat t .
 
luminous
(1) Producing or seeming to produce light . (2) Filled with light .


E.g.
 She ended her recital with a luminous performance of Ravel's song cycle, and the crowd called her back for repeated encores.


Luminous, like it s synonyms radiant, shining, glowing, and lustrous, is generally a positive adjective, especially when it describes something that doesn't literally glow, such as a face, a performance, or a poem. Luminous signs depend on a gas such as neon, krypt on, argon, xenon, or radon-and you can use luminous (DayGlo) paint to make your own signs. New technologies have now given us luminous fabrics, which are being used to produce striking or creepy effect s in clothing, upholstery, and interior surfaces.
 
bioluminescent
             Relating to light given off by living organisms.


E.g.
 Most of the lightemit ted by bioluminescent marine organisms is blue or blue-green.


Bio- comes from the Greek word for "life" (see BIO). On land, fireflies, glowworms, and the fox- fire fungus are all known for their bioluminescence. In the sea, bioluminescent life-forms include plankt on, squid, and comb jellies, as well as some unusual fish. Most deep-sea animals are bioluminescent , but single-celled algae living at or near the surface can also create a remarkable show, as they often do in Bioluminescent Bay on the Puerto Rican island  of Vieques. But bioluminescence is unknown in true plant s, and mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians never got the knack of iteither.
 
luminary A very famous or distinguished person.


E.g.
 Entering the glit tering reception room, she immediately spot ted several luminaries of the art world.


The  Latin  word luminaria  could  mean  either  "lamps"  or  "heavenly  bodies."  For  medieval astrologers, the luminaries were the sun and the moon, the brightest object s in the heavens. Today a luminary is usually a person of "brilliant " achievement : a celebrity, a "leading light ," or a "star."
 

 
Words from Mythology and History

muse                  A source of inspiration; a guiding spirit .


E.g.
 At 8:00 each morning he sat down athis desk and summoned his muse, and she almostalways responded.


The Muses were the nine Greek goddesses who presided over the art s (including music) and literature. A shrine to the Muses was called in Latin a museum. An artist or poetabout to begin work would call on his particular Muse to inspire him, and a poem it self might begin with such a call; thus, Homer's Odyssey begins, "Sing to me of the man, Muse" (thatis, of Odysseus). Today a muse may be one's special creative spirit , but some artist s and writers have also chosen living human beings to serve as their muses.
 
iridescent
   Having a glowing, rainbowlike play of color that seems to change as the light shift s.


E.g.
 The children shrieked with glee as the iridescent soap bubbles floated away in the gent le breeze.


Iris, the Greek goddess of the rainbow, t ook messages from Mount Olympus to earth, and from gods to mortals or other gods, using the rainbow as her stairway. Iridescence is thus the glowing, shifting, colorful quality of a rainbow, also seen in an opal, a light oil slick, a but terfly wing, or the mother-of-pearl that lines an oyster shell.
 
mausoleum                          (1) A large  t omb, especially  one  built  aboveground  with shelves for the dead. (2) A large, gloomy building or room.


E.g.
 The family's grand mausoleum occupied a prominent spotin the cemetery, for all the good it did the silent dead within.


Mausolus was ruler of a kingdom in Asia Minor in the 4th century B.C. He beautified the capital, Halicarnassus, with all sort s of fine public buildings, buthe is best known for the magnificent monument , the Mausoleum, that was built by his wife Artemisia after his death. With it s greatheight (perhaps 140 feet ) and many beautiful sculptures, the Mausoleum was declared one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Though Halicarnassus was repeatedly at tacked, the Mausoleum would survive for well over 1,000 years.
 
ment or                        A trusted counselor, guide, t ut or, or coach.


E.g.
 This pleasant old gent leman had served as friend and ment or to a series of young lawyers in the firm.


Odysseus was away from home fighting and journeying for 20 years, according to Homer. During that time, the son he leftas a babe in arms grew up under the supervision of Ment or, an old and trusted friend. When the goddess Athena decided it was time to complete young Telemachus's education by sending him off to learn abouthis father, she visited him disguised as Ment or and they set out t ogether. Today, anyone such as a coach or t ut or who gives another (usually younger) person help and advice on how to achieve success in the larger world is called a ment or. And in recentyears we've even been using the word as a verb, and now in business we often speak of an experienced employee mentoring someone who has justarrived.
 
narcissism
  (1) Extreme self-centeredness or fascination with oneself. (2) Love or desire for one's own body.


E.g.
 His girlfriend would complain abouthis narcissism, saying he spent more time looking athimself in the mirror than ather.


Narcissus was a handsome youth in Greek mythology who inspired love in many who saw him. One was the nymph Echo, who could only repeat the last thing thatanyone said. When Narcissus cruelly rejected her, she wasted away to nothing buther voice. Though he played with the affections of others, Narcissus became a victim of his own at tractiveness. When he caught sight of his own reflection in a pool, he sat gazing atitin fascination, wasting away without food or drink, unable to t ouch or kiss the image he saw. When he finally died, the gods turned him into the flower we call the narcissus, which stands with it s head bentas though gazing atit s reflection. People with "narcissistic personality disorder" have a somewhat serious mental condition, according to psychologist s, but the rest of us are free to call anyone who seems vain and self-centered a narcissist.
 
tantalize                       To tease or t orment by offering something desirable but keeping it out of reach.


E.g.
 The sight of a warm fire through the window tantalized the lit t le match girl almost unbearably.


King Tantalus, according to Greek mythology, killed his son Pelops and served him to the gods in a stew for dinner. Almostall the gods realized what was happening and refused the meal, though only after Demeter had taken a nibble out of  Pelops's  shoulder. After  they  had reconstructed him, replacing the missing shoulder with a piece of ivory, they turned to punishing Tantalus. In Hades he stands in water up to his neck under a tree laden with fruit . Each time he st oops to drink, the water moves out of reach; each time he reaches up to pick something, the branches move beyond his grasp. He is thus eternally tantalized by the water and fruit . Today anything or anyone that tempt s butis unobtainable is tantalizing.
 
thespian
 An act or.


E.g.
 In summer the t owns of New England welcome troupes of thespians dedicated to presenting plays of all kinds.


Greek drama was originally entirely performed by choruses. According to tradition, the Greek dramatist Thespis, of the 6th century B.C., was the invent or of tragedy and the first to write roles for the individual act or as distinct from the chorus, and the act or's exchanges with the chorus were the first dramatic dialogue. Since Thespis himself performed the individual part s in his own plays, he was also the first true act or. Ever since choruses disappeared from drama, thespians have filled all the roles in plays. Thespian is also an adjective; thus, we can speak of "thespian ambitions" and "thespian traditions," for example.
 
zephyr                   (1) A breeze from the west . (2) A gent le breeze.


E.g.
 Columbus left Genoa sailing against  the  zephyrs  that  continually  blow  across  the Mediterranean.


The ancient Greeks called the west wind Zephyrus and regarded him and his fellows-Boreas (god of the north wind), Eurus (god of the east wind), and Not us (god of the south wind)-as gods. A zephyr is a kind wind, bringer of clear skies and beautiful weather.

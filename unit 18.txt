CAPIT, from the Latin word for "head," caput, turns up in some important places. The head of a ship is it s captain, and the capital of a state or country is where the "head of state" works. A capital let ter stands head and shoulders above a lowercase let ter, as well as at the head (beginning) of a sentence.
 
capitalism                          An economic system based on private ownership, private decisions, and open competition in a free market .


E.g.
 In the 1980s, the leaders of the free world had faith that capitalism and a free-marketeconomy would solve all our problems.


Capital is wealth-thatis, money and goods-that 's used to produce more wealth. Capitalism is practiced enthusiastically by capitalists, people who use capital to increase production and make more goods and money. Capitalism works by encouraging competition in a fair and open market . It s opposite is often said to be socialism. Where a capitalisteconomy encourages private actions and ownership, socialism prefers public or government ownership and control of part s of the economy. In a pure capitalist system, there would be no public schools or public parks, no government programs such as Social Security and Medicare, and maybe noteven any public highways or police. In a pure socialist system, there wouldn't be any  private corporations. In other words, there's justabout no such thing as pure capitalism or pure socialism in the modern world.
 
capit ulate
      To surrender or st op resisting; give up.


E.g.
 At 2:00 a.m. the last three senat ors finally capit ulated, allowing the bill to move forward.


Capitulation often refers to surrender on the bat t lefield. Originally it only referred to surrender according to an agreement , though that part of the meaning is often absent . Today a teacher can capit ulate to her st udent s' cries of protestagainsta homework assignment , or a father can capit ulate to his kids' pleas to st op for ice cream, when the only terms of the agreementare that they'll st op complaining.
 
decapitate                      (1) To  cut  off  the  head; behead. (2) To  destroy  or make useless.


E.g.
 The leaders of the uprising were decapitated, and their heads were mounted on long poles on London Bridge as a warning to the people.


Decapitation is a quick and fairly painless way to go, so it was once considered suitable only for nobles like Sir Walter Raleigh, Mary Queen of Scot s, and two of Henry V I's unfort unate wives. The invention of the guillotine in the 18th century was meant to make execution swifter and more painless than hanging or a badly aimed blow by the executioner's sword.
 
recapit ulate
      To repeat or summarize the mostimportant point s or stages.


E.g.
 At the end of his talk, the president carefully recapit ulated the main point s in order.


Capitulation originally meant the organizing of material under headings. So recapitulation usually involves the gathering of the main ideas in a brief summary. Buta recapit ulation may be a complete restatementas well. In many pieces of classical music, the recapit ulation, or recap, is the long final section of a movement , where the earlier music is restated in the main key.
 
ANTHROP comes from the Greek word for "human being." So an anthropomorphic god, such as Zeus or Athena, basically looks and act s like a human. And in Aesop's fables and many animated cart oons, animals are usually anthropomorphized and behave exact ly like furry, four- legged human beings.
 
anthropoid
      Any of several large, tailless apes.


E.g.
 The  chimpanzees,  gorillas,  orangutans,  gibbons,  and  bonobos   are  all  classified   as anthropoids.


With it s suffix -oid, meaning "resembling," the word anthropoid means literally "resembling a human being." Anthropoid apes are so called because they resemble humans more closely than do other primates such as monkeys and lemurs. Some even spend a good deal of time walking on their hind legs. Anthropoids are, of course, highly intelligent (though maybe no more so than many monkeys), and some of them use sticks and st ones as t ools. (Butif you call someone an anthropoid, you're probably not complimenting his intelligence.)
 
anthropology
      The science and st udy of human beings.


E.g.
 By st udying the cultures of primitive peoples, anthropology may give us  a  bet ter understanding of our own culture.


Anthropologists, those who st udy the whys and wherefores of human existence, t oday look not only at the tribes of the Amazon butalso at the neighborhoods of Brooklyn or Santa Monica. Every group and every culture now seems to be possible material for anthropology. Some anthropologist s specialize in the st udy of human evolution, some st udy human language, some st udy archaeology, and some st udy human culture through the ages. Unlike hist orians, they tend to focus less on whathas been recorded in writings than on what can be discovered in other ways.
 
misanthropic
     Hating or distrusting humans.


E.g.
 Few characters in literature are more misanthropic than Ebenezer Scrooge, who cares for nothing but money.


Jonathan Swift was famous for the misanthropy of works such as Gulliver's Travels  which make fun of all kinds of human foolishness. Butin spite of his apparent misanthropic at tit ude, he spenta third of his income on founding a hospital and another third on other charities- certainly not the act s of a true misanthrope. Today we often use synonyms such as cynic and grinch for misanthropic types-while hoping we don't meet t oo many of them.
 
lycanthropy                     (1)  A   delusion   that   one   has   become   a   wolf.  (2) Transformation into a wolf through witchcraft or magic.


E.g.
 The local farmers avoided the resident s of the village in the next valley, who had long been suspected of grave robbing and lycanthropy.


The Greek word for "wolf," lykos, combines with the anthro- root to produce the meaning "wolfman." In European folklore, dating back to the ancient Greeks and Romans, there are men who change into wolves at nightand devour animals, people, or graveyard corpses before returning to human form at dawn. Werewolves, or lycanthropes, may be evil and possessed by the devil, or may instead be the victims of a werewolf bite and thereby cursed to change into wolf form at the full moon. The werewolf's evil intention is shown by it s eating only part of the animal or corpse, rather than all of it like a truly hungry wolf.
 

 
KINE comes from the Greek word kinesis, meaning "movement ." Kinetic energy is the energy of motion (as opposed to potential energy, the kind of energy held by a stretched elastic band). Kinetic artis art thathas moving part s, such as Alexander Calder's famous mobiles. And cinema, the art of moving pictures, actually comes from the same kine- rootas well.
 
kinesiology
       The scientific st udy of human movement .


E.g.
 With a kinesiology degree in hand, she landed a job as a rehab therapist for patient s following heart surgery.


Kinesiologists st udy the acquisition of mot or skills, the mechanical aspect s of movement , and the body's responses to physical activity. A kinesiologist may work in a public-school fit ness program, design exercise programs for  people  with  and  without  disabilities, or  work  with patient s recovering from disease, accident s, and surgery. As a field of research, kinesiology focuses particularly on the mechanics of muscular activity.
 
hyperkinetic
    (1)  Relating to or  affected  with  hyperactivity.  (2) Characterized by fast -paced or frantic activity.


E.g.
 Noises Off is a hyperkinetic stage farce that moves ata breathless pace for a full hour and a half.


Since the prefix hyper- means "above, beyond" (see HYPER) , hyperkinetic describes motion beyond the usual. The word is usually applied to children, and often describes the condition of almost uncontrollable activity or muscular movement s called attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Kids with ADHD are usually not justhyperkinetic  but  also  inat tentive, forget ful, and flighty. Though they're often treated with drugs, many expert s believe there are bet ter ways of dealing with the problem. Lot s of people now shorten both hyperactive and hyperkinetic to simply hyper ("He's been hyper all morning"), but usually don't mean it t oo seriously.
 
kinescope
  A motion picture made from an image on a picture t ube.


E.g.
 In the archives she turned up several kinescopes of Ernie Kovacs's 1950s show, which she thoughthad been dumped into New York Harbor decades ago.


Kinescope, originally a trademark for the cathode-ray t ube in a TV, later became the name for a film of a TV screen showing a live broadcast . In order for a program to be seen beyond New York in the early days of TV, a kinescope had to be shipped from station to station. Though grainy and fuzzy, these were for a time the only way of capturing live shows. Butin 1951 Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball decided to film their comedy show rather than to broadcastit live, and in a few years live broadcast comedy and drama had vanished from the airwaves.
 
telekinesis
 The movement of object s without contact or other physical means, as by the exercise of an occult power.


E.g.
 Fascinated by telekinesis as a boy, he'd spenthours in his room trying to push a pencil off the table using only his mind.


Tele- in Greek means "far off" (see TELE). The eternally appealing idea of moving an objectremotely, using only psychic powers, has had a long life in films, TV shows, st ories and novels, video  games,  and  comics.  But  although  some  researchers  believe  in  the  existence  of telekinesis (also known as psychokinesis), most scientist s believe thatany reported experiences have been the result of fraud, wishful thinking, or naturally explainable event s.
 
DYNAM comes from the Greek dynamis, meaning "power." A dyne is a unit used in measuring force; an instrument that measures force is called a dynamometer. And when Alfred Nobel invented a powerful explosive in 1867, he named it dynamite.
 
dynamic                   (1)  Relating to physical  force  or  energy.  (2)  Continuously  and productively active and changing; energetic or forceful.


E.g.
 The situation has entered a dynamic phase, and what we knew aboutit last week has changed considerably by now.


Dynamic is the opposite of static, which means "not moving or active." So all living languages, for example, are dynamic rather than static, changing from year to year even when they don'tappear to be. A bust ling  commercial city like  Hong  Kong  is intensely dynamic, constant ly changing and adapting. A dynamic relationship-for example, the relationship bet ween housing values and interestrates charged by banks-is one  that  changes  all  the  time. Unfort unately, the word has been used so much by advertisers that we tend to forgetit s basic meaning.
 
dynamo                   (1) A power generat or, especially one that  produces direct  electric current . (2) A forceful, energetic person.


E.g.
 Even as they entered the power plant , the roar of the water covered the sound of the immense dynamos.


The dynamo was introduced in 1832 to produce electricity for commercial use. Like all later generat ors, the original dynamos changed mechanical energy (produced by steam, which was it self produced by burning coal) into electricity. The word is less used t oday thanit once was, since it 's often applied only to generat ors that produced directelectric current (DC) rather than alternating current (AC), which is now the standard. A human dynamo is a person who seems to have unlimited energy, such as New York's legendary mayor Fiorello La Guardia, whose forcefulness and vigor matched that of his intensely dynamic city.
 
aerodynamics
 (1) A science that  st udies the movement  of gases such as air and the way that object s move through such gases. (2) The qualities of an object thataffecthow easily itis able to move through the air.


E.g.
 Early aut omobile designs were based on the boxlike carriages drawn by horses, back when no one was even thinking aboutaerodynamics.


Aerodynamics began as a science around the time of the Wright brothers' first manned flight s. Since then, it 's become important to the building not only of aircraftand aut omobiles butalso of rocket s and missiles, trains, ships, and even such structures as bridges and tall buildings, which often have to withstand strong winds. An aerodynamic vehicle is one whose design helps itachieve the greatest speed and mostefficient use of fuel. Butalthough we might casually call any sleek car design aerodynamic, true aerodynamics is practiced not by artistic product designers butinstead by highly trained scientist s, and many people's lives depend on their work.
 
hydrodynamic
   Having to do with the science that st udies fluids in motion and the forces thatact on bodies surrounded by fluids.


E.g.
 Building levees to contain a flood present s complicated hydrodynamic problems.


Bernoulli's principle, which is basic to the science of hydrodynamics, says that the faster a fluid substance flows, the less out ward pressure itexert s. It shows the close relationship bet ween hydrodynamics and aerodynamics (which deals with the movement of air and other gases), since it can part ly explain how air will "lift " an airplane by the way it flows over the wings, and how a spoiler helps keep a race car's wheels pressed to the ground as itaccelerates. Hydrodynamics is sometimes applied t oday in st udying the surface of the planet s and even the stars. As used informally by boaters, hydrodynamic often means "hydrodynamically efficient ."
 

 
GRAD comes from the Latin noun gradus, "step" or "degree," and the verb gradi, "to step, walk." A grade is a step up or down on a scale of some kind, and a gradual change takes place in small steps.
 
gradation                       (1) A series made up of successive stages. (2) A step in an ordered scale.


E.g.
 In the fall, the leaves show gradations of color from deepestred to brightestyellow.


In the Boy Scout s, gradations of rank move upward from Tenderfoot to Eagle Scout . A violin or a voice can produce gradations of musical pitch t oo small to appear in writ ten music. In the 18th century Jonathan Swift could even write of "the several kinds and gradations of laughter, which ladies must daily practice by the looking-glass."
 
degrade               (1) To treat someone or something poorly and withoutrespect . (2) To make the quality of something worse.


E.g.
 They had feared for years that television was degrading the mental capacities of their children.


In Shakespeare's King Lear, the old king is degraded by the daughters he has given his kingdom t o. He finds it degrading, for instance, when the number of his guards is reduced from 100 to 25. His degradation seems complete when, after going mad, he's reduced to living in the wilderness. As you can see, degrade is often a synonym for humiliate.
 
gradient                       (1) Slope, grade. (2) A continuous change in measure, activity, or substance.


E.g.
 Steep temperature gradient s in the at mosphere are usually associated  with  unstable conditions.


Any slope can be called a gradient . In the interstate highway system, the maximum gradientis 6 percent ; in other words, the highway may never ascend more than 6 vertical feet over a distance of 100 feet . Any rate of change that 's shown on a graph may have a sloped gradient . Suppose the graph's horizontal axis shows the passage of time and it s vertical axis shows some activity; if the activity is happening very fast , then the gradient of the line on the graph will be steep, butif it 's slow the gradient will be gent le, or gradual.
 
retrograde                      (1) Moving  or performed  in  a  direction  that  is  backward  or opposite to the usual direction. (2) Moving t oward a worse or earlier state.


E.g.
 For the government to cover up the findings of it s scientific research instit utes was clearly a retrograde step.


Retrograde describes backwardness of one kind or another. If a country decided to go back to amputating the limbs of criminals, we might call that policy retrograde. A retrograde view of women might be  one  that  sees them basically  as housekeepers. Mars and  Jupiter show retrograde (backward) motion at some stages of their orbit s, though this is only because of the way we see them from the earth, not because of any real backward movement .
 
REG, from the Latin regula, meaning "rule," has given us many English words. Something regular follows a rule of some kind, even if it 's justa law of nature. A regime can be a form of rule or government . To regulate an industry means to make and enforce rules, or regulations, for it ; removing such rules is called deregulation.
 
regimen               A regular course of treat ment , usually involving food, exercise, or medicine.


E.g.
 As part of his training regimen, he was now swimming two miles, running seven miles, and bicycling 15 miles every day.


Americans love self-improvement , so they're constant ly adopting regimens: skin-care regimens, low-cholesterol regimens, weight -loss regimens, and the like. A course of medication may be complicated enough to deserve the name regimen, and a rehab regimen may require having your activities monit ored ata treat ment center. Mental regimens can also be valuable; researchers are finding that minds that get the mostexercise seem to last the longest .
 
interregnum                     (1) The time during which a throne is vacant bet ween two successive reigns or regimes. (2) A period during which the normal functions of government or control are suspended.


E.g.
 During the weeklong interregnum bet ween the CEO's death and the appoint ment of a new CEO, she felt that she was really running the whole show.


Every time a pope dies, there's an interregnum period before a new one is elected by the cardinals. In most democratic systems, however, the law specifies who should take office when a president or prime  minister  dies  unexpectedly,  and  since  the  power  usually  passes aut omatically, there's no true interregnum. The question of succession-thatis, of who should take over when a country's leader dies-has often presented huge problems for countries that lacked a constit ution, and in monarchies ithasn'talways been clear who should become king or queen when a monarch dies. The interregnum following the death of Edward VI in 1553, for instance, was briefly suspended when Lady Jane Grey was installed as Queen; nine days later she was replaced by Mary Tudor, who senther straight to the Tower of London.
 
regalia                        (1) The emblems and symbols of royalty. (2) Special or official dress.


E.g.
 The governor seems to enjoy life in the governor's mansion and all the regalia of office more than actually doing his job.


Justas regal describes a king or queen-thatis, a ruler-regalia originally meant the things, and especially the dress and decoration, that belong exclusively to a monarch. The British monarchy's regalia include the crown jewels (crown, scepter, orb, sword, et c.) that lend luster to royal coronations. Academic regalia-the caps, gowns, and hoods worn by st udent s receiving their degrees-link instit utions to their past by preserving the dress worn at universities since their beginnings in the Middle Ages, when long hooded robes were needed for warmth.
 
regency                     A government or period of time in which a regentrules in place of a king or queen.


E.g.
 Since the future king was only four when Louis XIV died, France spenteightyears under a regency before he t ook the throne at 13 as Louis XV.


In Britain, the years from the time when George I was declared insane until his death (1811- 1820) are known as the Regency period, since in these years his son, the future George IV, served as Prince Regent , or acting monarch. (Sometimes the term covers the period up to the end of George IV's own reign in 1830.) The Regency is remembered for it s elegantarchitecture and fashions, it s literature (especially the works of Jane Austen), and it s politics. Today hotels, furniture, and businesses on both sides of the At lantic carry the name "Regency" to identify with the period's style, and hundreds of modern romance novels-called simply "Regencies"- have been setin the period. Though there have been dozens of European regencies over the centuries, for Americans t oday there seems to be only one Regency.
 

 
CRIT comes from a Greek verb that means "to judge" or "to decide." So a film critic judges a movie and tells us what 's good or bad aboutit . Her critical opinion may convince us not to go, or we may overlook any negative criticism and see itanyway.
 
criterion
A standard by which a judgment or decision is made.


E.g.
 He's one of those readers whose main criterion for liking a book is whether it confirms his prejudices.


One person's principal criterion for a new car may be it s gas mileage, while someone else's may be whether ithas room for four children. When filling a job opening, employers usually look for several criteria (notice the plural form) in the applicant s; and when college admissions officers are reading st udentapplications, they likewise always keep a few basic criteria in mind. And when interviewing an applicant , one criterion for both the employer and the admissions officer mightinclude the size of the applicant 's vocabulary!
 
critique               A judgment or evaluation, especially a rating or discussion of merit s and fault s.


E.g.
 Whenever he reads his latest st ory in the fiction-writing seminar, one of the other st udent s always delivers a nasty critique.


Even though criticize means to judge something negatively, a  critique  can  be  completely positive-or completely negative. Usually it 's somewhere in bet ween. When a paper of yours receives a critique from a teacher, you should read it carefully, and then reread it ; get ting mad or offended is the worst way to react . Critique is often a verb as well. Thus, writers and artist s often form groups solely to critique each other's work, and scientific articles frequent ly get critiqued in let ters to the edit or in the following issue of the journal.
 
hypercritical
    Overly critical.


E.g.
 Most teachers do their best to correct their st udent s' mistakes without seeming hypercritical.


The important prefix hyper- means "excessive" or "beyond" (see HYPER), so hypercritical means basically "t oo fussy." In TV and film comedies, the mother-in-law is justaboutalways hypercritical, since the person her child married is never good enough for her. But  other parent s, spouses, and even children can be justas bad, so we should all be careful. If your father asks whatyou think of his new experimental meat loaf and you say it needs a pinch of oregano, you're being constructive; if you say he should cut down on the sawdust next time, you're probably being hypercritical.
 
hemat ocrit
      The ratio of the volume of red blood cells to whole blood.


E.g.
 The latest blood testhad revealed thather hemat ocrithad risen considerably and was almost back to normal.


Our blood is most ly made up of four component s: plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and colorless blood cells called platelet s. An instrument called a hemat ocrit (because it "judges" the blood) is used to separate a sample of blood into it s component s. The normal hemat ocrit for men is about 48%, for women about 38%. An abnormal proportion of red blood cells, either t oo many or t oo few, is a good early indicat or of many diseases. So when you give blood as part of a physical exam, your hemat ocritis one of the findings your doct or will often check.
 
JUR comes from the Latin verb jurare, "to swear, take an oath," and the noun jus, "right or law." A jury, made  up  of jurors, makes judgment s based on the law. And a personal injury was originally something done to you thata court would find unjust .
 
jurisprudence
(1) A system of law. (2) The st udy and philosophy of law.


E.g.
 As a young lawyer his heroes were the crusaders of 20th-century jurisprudence, especially Louis Brandeis and Thurgood Marshall.


Jurisprudence as a st udy may have begun in the Roman empire, where schools of law were firstestablished. And Roman jurisprudence, like so many other things the Romans created, served as the model in later centuries throughout the Western world. And like many other legal words, jurisprudence is used only in formal writing.
 
abjure                  To reject formally.


E.g.
 The Spanish Inquisition forced many Jews to abjure their religion and adopt Christianity or be burned at the stake.


From it s Latin root s, abjure would mean literally "to swear away." Thus, after the holidays many people abjure all sweet s and fat tening foods, often making their vow in front of friends or relatives. Abjure is often confused with adjure, which means "to command solemnly, as if under oath." Thus, a judge mightadjure a criminal to change his ways; butit 's up to the criminal to abjure a life of crime.
 
perjury                        The crime of telling a lie under oath.


E.g.
 Found guilty of perjury for lying under oath in front of a Congressional commit tee, he was sentenced to two years in prison.


The prefix per- in Latin often meant "harmfully." So wit nesses who perjure themselves do harm to the truth by knowingly telling a lie. Notall lying is perjury, only lying under oath; so perjury generally takes place either in court or before a legislative body such as Congress. To avoid commit ting perjury, a wit ness or defendant may "take the Fifth": thatis, refuse to answer a question because the answer might be an admission of guilt , and the Fifth Amendment to the Constit ution forbids forcing a citizen to admit to being guilty of a crime.
 
de jure                      Based on or according to the law.


E.g.
 The country is a de jure democracy, but since one party controls all the media out let s itreally isn't one.


Coming straight from Latin, de jure is a term used most ly, but notalways, in legal writing. Sometimes it 's notenough to have something writ ten into law; if a law isn'tenforced, it mightas well notexist . And if ordinary citizens are t oo scared of what would happen to them if they exercised their right s, then they don'treally have those right s atall. Unfort unately, many countries have constit utions and laws that sound good but turn out not to have much effect . So de jure is almostalways used in contrast to something else; it s opposite is de facto (see de fact o).
 

 
Number Words

PENT comes from the Greek word for "five." The Pentagon in Washingt on, D.C., the world's largest office building, has five sides just like any other pentagon. And a pentatonic scale in music has only five notes, rather than the seven notes of the major or minor scale.
 
pentathlon                      An athletic contestin which each athlete competes in five differentevent s.


E.g.
 The modern Olympic pentathlon includes swimming, cross-country running, horseback riding, fencing, and target shooting.


The Greek word athlos means "contest or trial," so to be an athlete you had to compete in physical contest s. The ancient Greek pentathlon tested warriors' skills in sprinting, long jumping, javelin throwing, discus throwing, and wrest ling, none of which are part of t oday's Olympic pentathlon. Buta pentathlete must still have muscles and reflexes suited to almostany kind of physical feat . See also decathlon.
 
Pentateuch                        The first five books of the Old Testament , traditionally said to have been writ ten by Moses.


E.g.
 The Pentateuch takes us from the creation of the world up to the Israelites' arrival in the Promised Land.


Pentateuch means simply "five books." In Greek, the Pentateuch (which Jews call the Torah) includes the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These contain some of the oldestand most famous st ories in the Bible, including those of Adam and Eve, Jacob and his brothers, and Moses, as well as some of the oldest codes of law known, including the Ten Commandment s.
 
pentameter
 A line of poetry consisting of five metrical feet .


E.g.
 Shakespeare's tragedies are writ ten mainly in  blank  verse,  which  is  unrhymed  iambic pentameter.


In a line of poetry writ ten in perfectiambic pentameter, there are five unstressed syllables, each of which is followed by a stressed syllable. Each pair of syllables is a metrical foot called an iamb. Much of the greatest poetry in English has been writ ten in iambic pentameter; Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Milt on used it more than any other meter. Robert Frost 's line "I'm going out to clean the pasture spring" is an example of it ; his "And miles to go before I sleep" is instead an example of iambic tetrameter, with only four accented syllables.
 
Pentecostal
Of or relating to any of various fundamentalist sect s that stress personal experience of God and vocal expression in worship.


E.g.
 Their neighbors belonged to a Pentecostal sectand, homeschooled their daughters, who never wore clothes more revealing than floor-length skirt s and long pant s.


In ancient Greek, pentekoste meant "fiftieth day"-thatis,  the  fiftieth  day  after  Easter (counting Easter it self). On that day, Christians celebrate an event described in the Bible that  t ook place fifty days after Christ 's resurrection, when the apost les heard the rush of a mighty wind, saw t ongues of fire descending on them, and heard the Holy Spirit speaking from their own mouths butin other t ongues (languages). "Speaking in t ongues," when everyone in a congregation may begin talking in languages that no one can understand, is the best -known practice of Pentecostals. Pentecostals belong to many different denominations; with growing numbers especially in Latin America and Africa, there may be over 500 million Pentecostals worldwide.
 
QUINT comes from the Latin word meaning "five." Quintuplets are babies that come in set s of five; about 60 U.S. families increase in size by that number every year.
 
quincentennial
   A 500th anniversary, or the celebration of such an event .


E.g.
 In 1992 Americans celebrated the quincentennial of Christ opher Columbus's first voyage to the New World.


The United States is such a young country thatit will be quite some time before we reach our quincentennial as a nation: 2276 A.D., to be exact . Some American cities will celebrate their quincentennials long before that , buteven St . Augustine, Florida, the nation's oldest city, will have to wait until 2065. Meanwhile, many  young  people  can  look  forward  happily to our national tricentennial in 2076; and their grandchildren may be around for our quadricentennial in 2176.
 
quintessential
Representing the purest or most perfectexample of something.


E.g.
 As a boy, he had thought of steak, eggs, and home fries as the quintessential Saturday breakfast .


The philosophers and scientist s of the ancient world and the Middle Ages believed that the world we inhabit  was entirely made up of four element s: earth, air, fire, and water. Arist ot le added a fifth element , the aether or ether, by which he meant the material that fills the rest of space, most ly invisibly but sometimes taking the form of stars and planet s.

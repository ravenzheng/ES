PUT comes from the Latin verb putare, meaning "to think, consider, or believe." So, for example, a reputation is what others think of you. But when the root shows up in such words as compute, dispute, and deputy, it s meaning is harder to trace.
 
reputed                           Believed to be a certain way by popular opinion.


E.g.
 The 15th-century prince Vlad the Impaler is reputed to have inspired the character Dracula, though in fact , evil though Vlad was, Dracula's creat or only borrowed his nickname.


Reputed is used constant ly t oday by reporters, and almostalways to describe suspected criminals-"the reputed mobster," "the reputed drug kingpin," "the reputed gang leader," et c. But the word shouldn't be left to journalist s; your elderly aunt may, for instance, be reputed to have made a large fort une in oil, or to have had four husbands who all died mysteriously. Reputed is easy to confuse with reputable, and they used to mean the same thing-thatis, "having a good reputation"-but  it 's become rare to hear reputed used with that  meaning t oday.
 
disrepute
 Loss or lack of good reputation; disgrace.


E.g.
 The family had fallen into disrepute after the conviction and imprisonment of his father and uncle.


A reputation can be easy to lose, and someone who is no longer respectable may eventually find he's become genuinely disreputable-the kind of person thatalmost no one want s to be seen with. Disrepute isn't only for individuals: A company may fall into disrepute as a result of news st ories aboutit s product s' defect s; drug scandals have broughtentire sport s into disrepute; and a scientific theory may fall into disrepute as a result of new discoveries.
 
impute                      To at tribute.


E.g.
 The British imputed  motives  of  piracy to American  ships  trying to prevent  them  from interfering with American trade during the War of 1812.


Imputing something to someone (or something) usually means observing something invisible in that person (or thing). We may impute meaning to a play or novel, or to a casual remark by a friend, that was never intended. Many of us like to impute bad motives to others, while always regarding our own motives as pure. In tax law, imputed income is something thatisn'tactual money but mightas well be-for example, the free use of a car lent to you by your employer.
 
putative                          Generally supposed; assumed to exist .


E.g.
 To strengthen the case for the defense, a putative expert t ook the stand.


Putative is almostalways used to express doubt or skepticism abouta common belief. Thus, Tintagel Cast le in Cornwall, a picturesque ruin, is the putative fortress of the medieval King Arthur. The resident s of New York City are putatively chic, neurotic, rude, and dangerous. And cable TV is full of putative expert s, who often turn out not to have much knowledge of the subject s they're talking about .
 
LOG, from the Greek word logos, meaning "word," "speech," or "reason," is found particularly in English words thatend in -logy and -logue. The ending -logy often means "the st udy of"; so, for instance, biology is the st udy of life, and anthropology is the st udy of humans. And -logue usually indicates a type of discussion; thus, dialogue is conversation bet ween two people or groups, and an epilogue is an author's last words on a subject . Butexceptions aren'thard to find.
 
physiology
  (1) A branch of biology dealing with the processes and activities by which living things, tissues, and cells function. (2) The life processes and activities of a living thing or any of it s part s.


E.g.
 For st udent s planning to go to medical school, the university's most popular major is Human Physiology.


The Latin root physio- generally means "physical," so human physiology deals with justabouteverything that keeps us alive and working, and other physiology specialties do the same for other animals and for plant s. To do anything serious in the field of health, you've obviously got to know how the body's organs and cells function normally. Physiology used to be considered separately from anat omy, which focuses on the body's structures; however, it 's now known that structure and function can'teasily be separated in a scientific way, so "anat omy and physiology" are often spoken of in the same breath.
 
methodology
     A set of methods or rules followed in a science or field.


E.g.
 Some researchers claimed that Dr. Keller's methodology was sloppy and had led to unreliable conclusions.


The methodology employed in an experimentis essential to it s success, and bad methodology has spoiled thousands of research project s. So whenever a piece of research is published in a scientific or  medical  journal, the  researchers  always  carefully  describe  their  methodology; otherwise, other scientist s couldn't possibly judge the quality of what they've done.
 
ideology
  The set of ideas and beliefs of a group or political party.


E.g.
 By the time she turned 19, she realized she no longer believed in her family's political ideology.


The rootideo-, as you might guess, means "idea." Ideas and theories abouthuman behavior can always be carried t oo far, since such behavior is very hard to pin down. So ideological thinkers-people who come up with large theories abouthow the world works and try to explain everything (and maybe even predict the future) according to those  theories-are almostalways disappointed, sooner or later, to find thatit doesn'treally work out . A person intensely  devoted to a  set  of  political  ideas  or  theories  can  be  called  an ideologue-a translation of the French id¨¦ologue, a word actually coined by Napoleon as a label for those political thinkers full of ideas he had no use for.
 
cardiology
 The st udy of the heartand it s action and diseases.


E.g.
 After his heartat tack, he  actually boughthimself a  cardiology text book and  setabout learning everything he could abouthis unreliable organ.


The root card- (closely related to cord-see CORD) shows up in many heart -related words. Cardiologists frequent ly find themselves st udying cardiograms, the chart s of heartactivity, made by machines called cardiographs. Heartat tacks, and deaths caused by them, have both declined as a result of bet ter medical emergency procedures, cholesterol-lowering drugs, and a decline in smoking. But the fact ors likely to actually improve hearthealth, such as bet ter diet s and more cardiovascular exercise (exercise, such as running, thatimproves the heartand blood vessels), haven't made any progress atall. So we should all be prepared to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (an emergency procedure done on someone whose hearthas st opped, to get the heartand lungs working again).
 

 
TERR comes from the Latin terra, "earth." A territory is a large expanse of land. Terra firma is Latin for "firm ground" as opposed to the swaying seas. A terrace is a leveled area, often one created for farming on a sloping hill. And the French word for potat o, pomme de terre, means literally "apple of the earth."
 
parterre               (1) A decorative garden with paths bet ween the beds of plant s. (2) The back area of the ground floor of a theater, often under the balcony.


E.g.
 The city's park boast s a beautiful parterre with many varieties of roses.


Parterre comes to English by way of French, where it means "on the ground." And in the early years of the theater, the parterre was truly on the ground. In Shakespeare's day, an English theater's parterre was the cheap standing-room area rightin front of the stage, normally filled with rowdy spectat ors. The original idea of the French parterre garden, with it s carefully designed plot s and walkways, was to presentan artistic pat tern when seen from above-from a balcony, a raised terrace, or the t op of an out door staircase. English gardeners responded with garden designs that tried to make their viewers  half-forget  that  they  were  seeing something created by humans rather than untamed nature it self.
 
subterranean
      Underground.


E.g.
 In Carlsbad Caverns National Park there is an ast onishing subterranean chamber over half a mile long.


A t unnel is a subterranean road or pathway, and a subway is a subterranean railway. The subterranean vault s at Fort Knox hold billions of dollars of gold reserves. Subterranean reservoirs called aquifers are tapped  for  water;  in  places  where  the  pressure  on  the subterranean water is greatenough, a hole drilled in the ground will bring it bubbling to the surface.
 
terrarium
 An  enclosure, usually transparent , with  a  layer of  dirt  in  the bot t om in which plant s and sometimes small animals are keptindoors.


E.g.
 When no one was watching, they dropped their snake in the fifth-grade terrarium, and then waited in the hall to hear the screams.


The turt le exhibitata zoo is often in the form of a terrarium, as are some of the exhibit s ata plant conservat ory. In an ant terrarium, elementary-school st udent s watch the ant s dig their net work of t unnels as if no one were watching. Terrariums try to create conditions as close as possible to a natural habitat . A covered terrarium can often sustain it self for months on the moisture trapped inside. But creating a good terrarium requires careful control not only of humidity butalso of temperature, as well as good ventilation; the lighting should include the full spectrum of sunlightas well as a day-nightregulat or.
 
terrestrial                      (1) Having to do  with  Earth  or it s inhabitant s. (2) Living  or growing on land instead of in water or air.


E.g.
 The roadrunner, although a largely terrestrial bird, can take flight for short periods when necessary.


Everything on or having to do with Earth can be called terrestrial. Mercury, Venus, and Mars are often called the terrestrial planet s, since they are rocky balls somewhat like Earth rather than great globes of gas like Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Nept une. Something extraterrestrial comes from beyond the earth and it s at mosphere; the word can be used to describe anything "out of this world," from moon rocks to meteors. Turning to the second sense of terrestrial, animals are often divided into the terrestrial (land-living) and the aquatic (water-living). And sometimes terrestrial animals are contrasted with arboreal animals, those that live in trees.
 
MAR, from the Latin word mare, meaning "sea," brings it s salty tang to several English words. A submarine is an undersea ship. Marine means basically "relating to the sea," so when the Continental Marines were established back in 1775, their job was to provide on-board security on naval ships; but they immediately began to be used on land as well, and the marines have continued to operate on both land and sea ever since.
 
marina                        A dock or harbor where pleasure boat s can be moored securely, often with facilities offering supplies or repairs.


E.g.
 The coast of Florida has marinas all along it for the use of anything from flimsy sailboat s to enormous yacht s.


Marina comes straight from Latin, where it means simply "of the sea." Ata modern marina, sailors can acquire whatever they need for their nextexcursion, or they can tie up their boat s until the next weekend  comes  along. Some  even  imitate  John  D. MacDonald's  famous detective hero Travis McGee, who lives on his boatin Miami and rarely leaves the marina.
 
aquamarine                          (1) A transparent blue or blue-green gem. (2) A pale blue or greenish blue thatis the color of clear seawater in sunlight .


E.g.
 Many of the houses on the Italian Riviera  are  painted  aquamarine to match  the Mediterranean.


Aqua marina is Latin for "seawater," so when a lovely blue-green form of the semiprecious gem known as beryl was given an English name several centuries ago, aquamarine seemed appropriate. Aquamarine is the ideal color that most of us carry around in our heads when we imagine the waters that lap the shores of the Greek and Caribbean islands on a sunny day. Buteven the Mediterranean and the Caribbean can take on lot s of other colors depending on weather conditions.
 
mariner                           A seaman or sailor.


E.g.
 When he signed on as a mariner, the young Ishmael never suspected that the ship would be pursuing a great white whale.


In Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner, an old seaman tells of how, by shooting a friendly albatross, he had brought st orms and disaster to his ship, and how as punishment  his shipmates hung the great seabird around the mariner's neck and made him wear it until itrot ted. The word mariner has occasionally been used to mean simply "explorer," as in the famous Mariner spaceflight s in the 1960s and '70s, the first to fly close to Mars, Venus, and Mercury.
 
maritime                  (1) Bordering on or having to do with the sea. (2) Having to do with navigation or commerce on the sea.


E.g.
 As a result of the ocean, Canada's Maritime Provinces-New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island-have a late spring buta mild winter.


The maritime countries of Port ugal and England produced many seafaring explorers during the 16th and 17th centuries, many of whom sailed under the flags of other countries. Sailing for the Spanish, Ferdinand Magellan captained the ship that was the first to circle the world, charting many new maritime routes as it went . Henry Hudson, funded by the Dutch, sailed up what we call t oday the Hudson River, claiming the maritime area that now includes New York City for the Netherlands.
 

 
PATH comes from the Greek word pathos, which means "feeling" or "suffering." So a pathetic sight moves us to pity, and a sympathetic friend "feels with" you when you yourself are suffering.
 
pathos                  (1) An elementin life or drama that produces sympathetic pity. (2) An emotion of sympathetic pity.


E.g.
 The pathos of the blind child beggars she had seen in India could still keep her awake at night .


Pathos comes  direct ly  from Greek. According to Arist ot le, the persuasive power of public speaking relies on three element s: the speaker's authority, the logic of the speech, and the speech's pathos. Arist ot le claims that pathos is the appeal to the audience's sense of rightand wrong, and thatitis this (unlike authority and logic) that moves the audience's emotions. Today we usually speak of pathos as an elementin fiction, film, drama, music, or even painting, or the real-life pathos of a situation or personality. Since pathos is closely related to pathetic, it 's not surprising that , like pathetic, pathos may occasionally be used a bit sarcastically.
 
apathetic
    (1) Showing or feeling lit t le or no emotion. (2) Having no interest .


E.g.
 His apathetic response to the vict ory bewildered his friends.


Apathy, or lack of emotion, is central to Albert Camus's famous novel The Stranger, in which the main character's indifference t oward almosteverything, including his  mother's  death, result s in his imprisonment . We feel lit t le sympathy for him, and may even feel antipathy, or dislike. The American voter is often called apathetic; of all the industrial democracies, only in America does half the adult population fail to vote in major elections. As you can see, apathetic isn't the opposite of pathetic, even though the a- thatit begins with means "not " or "without ."
 
empathy The feeling of, or the ability to feel, the emotions and sensations of another.


E.g.
 Her maternal empathy was so strong that  she often seemed to be living her son's life emotionally.


In the 19th century, Charles Dickens counted on producing an empathetic response in his readers strong enough to make them buy the next  newspaper installment  of  each novel. Today, when reading a novel such as A Tale of Two Cities, only the mosthard-hearted reader could  fail to feel  empathy  for  Sidney  Cart on  as  he  approaches  the  guillotine. One  who empathizes suffers along with the one who feels the sensations direct ly. Empathy is similar to sympathy, butempathy usually suggest s stronger, more instinctive feeling. So a person who feels sympathy, or pity, for victims of a war in Asia may feel empathy for a close friend going  through the much smaller disaster of a divorce.
 
telepathic
   Involving apparent  communication from one mind to another without speech or signs.


E.g.
 After ten years of marriage, their communication is virtually telepathic, and each always seems to know what the other is thinking.


Since tele- means "distant " (see TELE), you can see how telepathy means basically "feeling communicated from a distance." The word was coined around 1880, when odd psychic phenomena were being widely discussed by people hoping thatresearchers might  find  a scientific basis for what they believed they themselves were experiencing. Today, when people  talk aboutextrasensory perception, or ESP, telepathy is usually what they're talking about . In recentyears, the notion of memes-ideas that might somehow physically fly from brain to brain so that people all over the world mighthave the same idea atabout  the same time withoutany obvious communication-has been widely discussed. Even though scientist s haven't been able to establish the existence of telepathy, about 30% of Americans continue to believe in it .
 
PEN/PUN comes from the Latin words poena, "penalty," and punire, "to punish." A penalty is, of course, a punishment.
 
penal                   Having to do with punishment or penalties, or instit utions where punishmentis given.


E.g.
 The classic novels Les Mis¨¦rables and The Count of Monte Cristo portray the  terrible conditions in French penal instit utions in the 19th century.


A state or country's penal code defines it s crimes and describes it s punishment s. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many countries established penal colonies, where criminals were sentas punishment . Often these were unbearably severe; butit was to such colonies that some of Australia's and the United States' early white inhabitant s came, and the convict s provided labor for the European set t lement of these lands.
 
impunity
      Freedom from punishment , harm, or loss.


E.g.
 Under the flag of truce, the soldiers crossed the field with impunity.


Impunity is protection from punishment , justas immunity is protection from disease. Tom Sawyer, in Mark Twain's novel, broke his Aunt Polly's rules with near impunity because he could usually sweet -talk her into forgiving him; if that failed, he had enjoyed himself so much he didn't care what punishment she gave him.
 
penance                 An act  of self-punishment  or religious devotion to show sorrow or regret for sin or wrongdoing.


E.g.
 In the Middle Ages bands of pilgrims would trudge to distantholy sites as penance for their sins.


Penance as a form of apology for a mistake can be either voluntary or ordered by someone else. Many religions include penance among the ways in which believers can show repentance or regret for a misdeed. The Christian season of Lent , 40 days long, is traditionally a time for doing penance.
 
punitive
Giving, involving, or aiming at punishment .


E.g.
 The least popular teachers are usually the ones with punitive at tit udes, those who seem to enjoy punishing more than teaching.


Punitive is an important word in the law. When you sue a person or company for having wronged you in some way, you normally ask for something of value equal to whatyou were deprived of by the other party. But when the defendanthas done something particularly bad, you may also ask for punitive damages, money over and above the actual cost of the harm done, intended to teach the defendanta lesson. Punitive damages are fairly rare, but when they're actually granted they may be as much as four times the size of the basic damages.
 

 
MATR/MATER comes from the Greek and Latin words for "mother." A matron is a mature woman with children. And matrimony is  marriage  it self, the  traditional  first  step  t oward motherhood.
 
maternity
     The state of being a mother; motherhood.


E.g.
 It 's quite possible that the Mona Lisa is a portrait of maternity, and that the painting marks the recent birth of her child Andrea.


Maternity is used as both a noun and an adjective. Maternity benefits are benefit s specially provided by employers for women having babies, and usually include maternity leave, time off work. With maternity come maternal feelings, which are shown by all species of warm-blooded animals as well as a few reptiles such as crocodiles and alligat ors.
 
matriarch
  A woman who controls a family, group, or government .


E.g.
 Every Augustall the grown children and their families are summoned to the estate by the matriarch.


A matriarchy is a social unit governed by a woman or group of women. Itisn't certain thata true matriarchal society has ever existed, so matriarchy is usually treated as an imaginative concept . But there are societies in which relatedness through women rather than men is stressed, and element s of matriarchy may be stronger in certain societies than they are in most of the Western world. And most of us can point to families in which a woman has become the dominant figure, or grande dame, or matriarch.
 
matrilineal
  Based on or tracing the family through the mother.


E.g.
 Many of the peoples of Ghana in Africa trace their family through matrilineal connections.


A person's lineage is his or her line of ancest ors. So matrilineal means basically "through the mother's line," justas patrilineal means "through the father's line." Matrilineality is an important conceptin anthropology; among other things, it usually determines who will inherit property on a person's death. Though families that follow the European model take the father's name and are therefore patrilineal, matrilineal societies have existed around the world, including among various American Indian tribes.
 
matrix                 (1) Something (such as a situation or a set  of  conditions) in which something else develops or forms. (2) Something shaped like a pat tern of lines and spaces.


E.g.
 The country's political matrix is so complex that no one who hasn't lived there could possibly understand it .


In ancientrome, a matrix was a female animal kept for breeding, or a plant (sometimes called a "parent plant " or "mother plant ") whose seeds were used for producing other plant s. In English the word has taken on many related meanings. Mathematicians use it for a rectangular organization of numbers or symbols that can be used to make various calculations; geologist s use it for the soil or rock in which a fossil is discovered, like a baby in the womb. And matrix was a good choice as the name of the reality in which all humans find themselves living in a famous series of science-fiction films.
 
AQU comes from aqua, the Latin word for "water." We keep pet fish in an aquarium athome or visit larger sea animals in a building with that name. Water sport s such as swimming, canoeing, and sailing are sometimes called aquatics. In Scandinavia there's a popular drink called aquavit, the name coming from the Latin aqua vitae, "water of life"-though instead of water it most ly consist s of alcohol.
 
aquaculture
The farming of plant s and animals (such as kelp, fish, and shellfish) that live in the water.


E.g.
 The farming of oysters by the Romans was an early form of aquaculture thathas continued to the present day.


For most of the modern hist ory of aquaculture, only cost ly fish and shellfish like salmon and shrimp were harvested. But  new  technologies  are  allowing  cheaper  and  more  efficient cultivation of fish for food, and such common fish as cod are now being farmed. Seaweeds and other algae are also being grown-for food (most ly in Asia), cat t le feed, fertilizer, and experimentally as a source of energy. Aquaculture is now the world's fastest -growing form of food production.
 
aquanaut                 A scuba diver who lives and works both inside and out side an underwater shelter for an extended time.


E.g.
 Each scientistat the laborat ory spent two weeks a year as an aquanaut living in the deep- sea station.


Aquanaut combines aqua with the Greek nautes, meaning "sailor." Like astronautand aeronaut, the word may remind you of those mythical Greek heroes known as the Argonaut s, who sailed with Jason on his ship, the Argo, in quest of the Golden Fleece. Various underwater habitat s for aquanaut s, such as Conshelf, SEALAB, and MarineLab, have captured the public imagination since the 1960s.
 
aqueduct (1) A pipe or channel for water. (2) A bridgelike structure for carrying water over a valley.


E.g.
 Roman aqueduct s were built throughout the empire, and their spectacular arches can still be seen in Greece, France, Spain, and North Africa.


Based  party on  the  Latin ducere, meaning  "lead"  or "conduct "  (see DUC/DUCT), the word aqueduct named an ancient civil-engineering marvel. You may have seen phot os of the greatarches of ancientaqueduct s spanning valleys in countries throughout the old Roman Empire, practical pipelines thatare also regarded as works of timeless beauty. From the 20th century, the 242-mile Colorado River Aqueduct , the 336-mile Central Arizona Project , and the 444-mile California  Aqueduct  are  considered  wonders  of  American  engineering,  but  they  are  notrenowned  for  their  beauty.  Most  aqueduct s  t oday  either  are  riverlike  channels  or  run underground, perhaps appearing simply as a long mound.
 
aquifer                           A layer of rock, sand, or gravel that can absorb and hold water.


E.g.
 Cities withoutaccess to a nearby lake or river mustrely on underground aquifers to meet their water needs.


The vast butrelatively shallow Ogallala Aquifer lies beneath the Great Plains, under portions of eight states. It s thickness ranges from a few feet to more than a thousand feet . The Ogallala yields about 30 percent of the nation's groundwater used for irrigation in agriculture, and provides drinking water for most of the people within the area. But for many years more water has been extracted from the Ogallala than has been returned, and the situation t oday is of great concern.
 

 
Words from Mythology

cereal       (1) A plant that produces grain that can be eaten as food, or the grain it produces. (2) The food made from grain.


E.g.
 Rice is the main food cereal of Asia, whereas wheatand corn are the main food cereals of the West .


The Roman goddess Ceres, the equivalent of the Greek Demeter, was a calm goddess who didn't take partin the quarrels of the other gods. Her particular responsibility was the food- giving plant s, and for thatreason the food grains came to carry her name. Cereals of the ancientromans included wheat , barley, spelt , oat s, and millet -but not corn (maize), which was a cereal of the Americas.
 
Junoesque
Having mature, poised, and dignified beauty.


E.g.
 In 1876, as a centennial gift , the French sent to America a massive stat ue of a robed Junoesque figure representing Liberty, to be erected in New York Harbor.


Juno was the wife of Jupiter, the chief of the Roman gods. As the firstamong goddesses, her power gave her particular dignity; and as goddess of women and marriage, she was a mature matron. But such younger goddesses as Diana, goddess of the hunt , perhaps came closer to t oday's ideals of slim and athletic female beauty.
 
martial                         Having to do with war and military life.


E.g.
 The stirring, martial strains of "The British Grenadiers" echoed down the snowy street justas dawn was breaking.


Mars was the Roman god of war and one of the patron gods of Rome it self. He was responsible for everything military, from warriors to weapons to marching music. Thus, martial arts are skills of combatand self-defense also practiced as sport . When martial law is declared, a country's armed forces take over the functions of the police. And a court-martial is a military court or trial.
 
Promethean
  New or creative in a daring way.


E.g.
 Beginning in the 1950s, the lit t le Asian countries of South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore began to display a Promethean energy that would become one of the marvels of the modern world.


Prometheus was a Titan, a generation older than Zeus. When Zeus overthrew his own father Cronus and seized power, Prometheus fought on the side of the gods and againsthis fellow Titans. But when Zeus later wanted to destroy the race of humans, Prometheus saved them by stealing fire for them from the gods. He also taught them how to write, farm, build houses, read the stars and weather, cure themselves when sick, and tame animals-in short , all the art s and skills that make humans unique. So inventive was he thatanything of great creativity and originality can still be called Promethean. But Prometheus had taken a terrible  risk; enraged by his disobedience, Zeus had him chained to a rocky cliff, where for many long centuries an eagle daily t ore athis liver.
 
Sisyphean
   Endless and difficult , involving many disappoint ment s.


E.g.
 After t wenty years, many researchers had begun to think that defeating the virus was a Sisyphean task that would never succeed.


Reputedly the cleverest man on earth, King Sisyphus of Corinth tricked the gods into bringing him back to life after he had died. For this they punished him by sending him back to the underworld, where he musteternally roll a huge rock up a long, steep hill, only to watch itroll back to where  he  started. Something  Sisyphean  demands  the  same  kind  of  unending, thankless, and ultimately unsuccessful effort s.
 
titanic                      Having great size, strength, or power; colossal.


E.g.
 The titanic floods of 1993 destroyed whole t owns on the Mississippi River.


In Greek mythology, the  Titans were  the  generation  of giant creat ors that produced  the younger, stronger, cleverer gods, who soon overpowered and replaced them (see Promethean above). In 1911 the largest ship thathad ever been built was christened the Titanic for it s unmatched size and strength. But the name may have proved unlucky; on it s maiden voyage in 1912 a massive iceberg ripped a fatal hole in the great ship, and it sank in the icy waters off Newfoundland.
 
Trit on                  (1) A being with a human upper body and the lower body of a fish; a merman.
(2) Any of various large mollusks with a heavy, conical shell.


E.g.
 In one corner of the painting, a robust Trit on emerges from the sea with his conch to announce the coming of the radiant queen.


Trit on was originally the son of the sea god Poseidon (or Nept une). A guardian of the fish and other creatures of the sea, he is usually shown as hearty, muscular, and cheerful. Like his father, he often carries a trident (three-pronged fork) and may ride in a chariot drawn by seahorses. Blowing on his conch shell, he creates the roar of the ocean. As a decorative image, Trit ons are simply the male version of mermaids. The handsome seashells that bear their name are the very conchs on which they blow. Trit on has also given his name to the planet Nept une's largest moon.
 
vulcanize                       To treat crude or synthetic rubber or plastic so thatit becomes elastic and strong and resist s decay.


E.g.
 The native islanders had even discovered how to vulcanize the rubber from the local trees in a primitive way.


The Roman god Vulcan (the Greek Hephaest us) was in charge of fire and the skills that use fire, especially blacksmithing. When Charles Goodyear almostaccidentally discovered how to vulcanize rubber in 1839, he revolutionized the rubber industry.

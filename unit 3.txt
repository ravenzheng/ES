AMBI means "on both sides" or "around"; ambi- comes from Latin. Most of us are either right - handed or left -handed, butambidextrous people can use their rightand lefthand equally well.
 
ambiguous
    (1) Doubt ful or uncertain especially from being obscure or indistinct . (2) Unclear in meaning because of being understandable in more than one way.


E.g.
 Successful politicians are good at giving ambiguous answers to questions on difficultissues.


Ambiguous comes from the Latin verb ambigere, "to be undecided." When we say someone's eyes are an ambiguous color, we mean we cannot decide which color they are-blue or greenE.g.
 Th e ambiguity of the Mona Lisa's smile makes us wonder what she's thinking about . An ambiguous order is one that can be taken in at least two ways; on the other hand, the order "Shut up!" may be rude butat leastit 's unambiguous.
 
ambient
 Existing or present on all sides.


E.g.
 The ambient lighting in the restaurant was low, and there was a bright candle ateach table.


Ambient lightis the light that fills an area or surrounds something that 's being viewed, like a television screen or a painting. Scientist s sometimes refer to the ambient  temperature, the temperature of the surrounding air. "Ambient music" is the term used t oday for "at mospheric" background music usually intended for relaxation or meditation. The candlelitrestaurantin the example sentence is probably trying for a romantic ambience, or "at mosphere."
 
ambivalent
(1) Holding opposite feelings and at tit udes at the same time t oward someone or something. (2) Continually wavering bet ween opposites or alternative courses of action.


E.g.
 He was ambivalentabout the trip: he badly wanted to travel buthated to miss the summer activities athome.


Ambivalentis a fairly new word, less than a hundred years old, and, not surprisingly, it was first used by psychologist s. Since being ambivalent means simply having mixed feelings about some question or issue, some of us spend most of our lives in a state of ambivalence. We might feel ambivalence aboutaccepting a high-paying job thatrequires us to work long hours, about lending money to someone we like but don't know well-or about ordering a Tut ti-Frut ti Chocolate Banana Sundae El Supremo after we've been starving on a strict diet for weeks.
 
ambit                      The range or limit covered by something (such as a law).


E.g.
 The treat ment of farm animals generally falls out side the ambit of animal-cruelty laws in the U.S.


Ambitis a rather formal term, often used by lawyers, as in, "With this new legislation, t obacco now falls within the ambit of FDA regulation." Italmostalways refers to something abstractrather than an actual physical range. So, for example, an immigrant might live completely within the ambit of her immigrant community until she started college, where she might find herself in a much broader social ambit . Most of the Latin American colonies were established by Spain, butin the 19th century, as the U.S. became stronger and Spain became weaker, they began to enter the ambit of U.S. power.
 
EPI is a Greek prefix that may mean various things, but usually "on, over" or "at tached t o." So an earthquake's epicenter is the ground right over the center of the quake. And your epidermis is the outer layer of your skin, on t op of the inner dermis.
 
epilogue                         The final section after the main part of a book or play.


E.g.
 Her edit or t old her the book really needed an epilogue, to tell where each member of the family is t oday.


From it s Greek root s, epilogue means basically "words at tached (at the end)." An epilogue often somehow wraps up a st ory's action, as in the one for a famous Shakespeare play thatends, "For never was a st ory of more woe / Than this of Julietand her Romeo." In nonfiction books, we now often use the term afterword instead of epilogue, justas we now generally use foreword instead of prologue (see LOG). Movies also often have a kind of epilogue-maybe a scene after the exciting climax when the surviving lovers meetin a caf®¶ to talk about their future. The epilogue of a musical composition, after all the drama is over, is called the coda (Italian for "tail").
 
epiphyte             A plant that obtains it s nutrient s from the air and the rain and usually grows on another plant for support .


E.g.
 The strangler fig begins life as an epiphyte on a tree branch, drops it s tendrils to take rootin the ground around the trunk, and slowly covers and strangles the tree to death.


Epiphytic plant s are sometimes known as "air plant s" because they seemingly survive on thin air. They rely on their  host plant s merely for  physical support , not nourishment . Tropical epiphytes include orchids, ferns, and members of the pineapple family. To a newcomer in the  tropical rain forest , the first sight of a great tree with large epiphytes hanging from every level can be eerie and ast onishing. Familiar epiphytes of the temperate zone include lichens, mosses, and algae, which may grow on rocks or water without t ouching the soil.
 
epitaph                      An inscription on a grave or t omb in memory of the one buried there.


E.g.
 The greatarchitect Christ opher Wren designed London's majestic St . Paul's Cathedral, the site of his t omb and epitaph: "Si monument um requiris, circumspice" ("If you seek my monument , look around you").


Epitaph includes the root from the Greek word taphos, "t omb" or "funeral."  Traditionally, epitaph refers to a t ombst one inscription, butit can also refer to brief memorial statement s thatresemble such inscriptions. One of the most famous is Henry Lee's epitaph for George Washingt on: "Firstin war, firstin peace, and firstin the heart s of his countrymen."
 
epithet                         (1) A descriptive word or phrase occurring with or in place of the name of a person or thing. (2) An insulting or demeaning word or phrase.


E.g.
 King Richard I of England earned the epithet "Lionhearted," while his brother, King John, was given the epithet "Lackland."


From it s Greek root s, epithet would mean something "put on," or added. Sometimes the added name follows a given name, as in Erik the Red or Billy the Kid. In other cases, the epithet precedes the personal name, as in Mahat ma ("Great -souled") Gandhi. In still others, it 's used in place of the actual name, as in El Greco ("The Greek") or El Cid ("The Lord"). In it s other common meaning, an epithetis a mocking or insulting name (like "Lackland" in the example sentence). When enemies are said to be "hurling epithet s" ateach other, it means they're exchanging angry insult s.
 

 
HYP/HYPO is a Greek prefix meaning "below, under." Many hypo- words are medical. A hypodermic needle inject s medication under the skin. Hypotension, or low blood pressure, can be justas unhealthy as the bet ter-known hypertension, or high blood pressure.
 
hypochondriac
     A person overly concerned with his or her own health who often suffers from delusions of physical disease.


E.g.
 Hercule Poirot , the detective hero of the Agatha Christie mysteries, is a not orious hypochondriac, always trying to protecthimself from draft s.


One disease a hypochondriac really does suffer from is hypochondria, the anxiety and depression that come from worrying t oo much about one's own health. Even though it 's easy to joke abouthypochondriacs, hypochondria is no joking mat ter for the sufferer. Somewhat surprisingly, the second part of hypochondria derives from chondros, the  Greek  word  for "cartilage." The cartilage in question is that of the sternum, or breast bone. From ancient times, doct ors believed that certain internal organs or regions were the seat of various diseases, both physical and mental, and the area under the breast bone was thought to be the source of hypochondria.
 
hypoglycemia
         Abnormal decrease of sugar in the blood.


E.g.
 She had been controlling her hypoglycemia through dietand vitamins, but she now realized she needed to add daily exercise as well.


The root glyk- means "sweet " in Greek, so glyc shows up in the names of various terms referring to a sugar as a chemical ingredient , such as glycerine and monoglyceride. People with diabetes have difficulty controlling the sugar in their blood. Too lit t le can be dangerous; it s early sympt oms may be as minor as nervousness, shaking, and sweating, butit can lead to seizures and unconsciousness. Luckily, it can be taken care of easily by eating or drinking something high in carbohydrates. It s opposite, hyperglycemia (see HYPER), is the main sympt om of diabetes, and usually requires an injection of insulin, which the sufferer usually gives himself. Today many people-though not doct ors-use hypoglycemia to mean a completely different condition, with some of the same milder sympt oms, that doesn'tinvolve low blood sugar.
 
hypothermia
      Subnormal temperature of the body.


E.g.
 By the time rescuers were able to pull the boy from the pond's icy waters, hypothermia had reached a life-threatening stage.


Hypothermia, which usually result s from submersion in icy water or prolonged exposure to cold, may constit ute a grave medical emergency. It begins to be a concern when body temperature dips below 95°„F, and the pulse, breathing, and blood pressure start to decline. Below 90°„, the pointat which the normal reaction of shivering ceases, emergency treat mentis called for.
 
hypothetical
(1)  Involving  an  assumption  made  for  the  sake  of argument or for further st udy or investigation. (2) Imagined for purposes of example.


E.g.
 The candidate refused to say what she would do if faced with a hypothetical military crisis.


The noun hypothesis comes straight from the Greek word meaning "foundation" or "base"- thatis something "put under" something else. So a hypothesis is something you assume to be true in order thatyou can use itas the base or basis for a line of reasoning-and any such assumption can be called hypothetical. So, for example, the theory that the dinosaurs became extinct because of a giant meteor that struck the earth near the Yucat ®¢n Peninsula involves the hypothesis that such a collision would have had such terrible effect s on the earth's climate that the great  reptiles would have been doomed. Once a hypothesis has been thoroughly st udied and researched without being proved wrong, it generally comes to be called a theory instead.
 
THERM/THERMO comes from the Greek word meaning "warm." A thermometer measures the amount of warmth in a body, the air, or an oven. A thermostat makes sure the temperature stays at the same level. And it 's easy to see why the German manufacturers of a vacuum- insulated bot t le back in 1904 gave it the name Thermos.
 
thermal                      (1) Of, relating t o, or caused by heat . (2) Designed to insulate in order to retain body heat .


E.g.
 A special weave called thermal weave traps insulating air in lit t le pocket s to increase the warmth of long underwear and blanket s.


In days gone by, much of the male population of the northern states in the cold months would wear a garment of thermal underwear covering the entire body, called a union suit . Union suit s kept sodbusters, cowboys, and t ownsfolk alike not only warm butalso itchy and a lit t le on the smelly side (back when bathing once a week was considered the height of  cleanliness). Thermal imaging is phot ography that  captures  "heat  pictures"-rather than ordinary  light pictures-of object s. And thermal pollution occurs when industrial water use ends up warming a river in a damaging way. Small-plane pilot s use thermal as a noun for a warm updraft , often over a plowed field or desert , that lift s their wings, justas itenables hawks to soar upward without moving their wings.
 
thermodynamics
            Physics that deals with the mechanical actions or relations of heat .


E.g.
 With his college major in electrical engineering, he assumed it would be an easy step to a graduate-school concentration in thermodynamics.


Thermodynamics (see DYNAM) is based on the fact thatall forms of energy, including heatand mechanical energy, are basically the same. Thus, it deals with the ways in which one form of  energy  is  converted  into  another,  when  one  of  the  forms  is  heat .  The  st udy  of thermodynamics dates from before the invention of the first practical steam  engine-an engine that uses steam to produce physical power-in the 18th century. Today most of the world's  electrical  power  is  actually  produced  by  steam  engines, and  the  principal  use  of thermodynamics is in power production.
 
thermonuclear
           Of or relating to the changes in the nucleus of at oms with low at omic weight , such as hydrogen, thatrequire a very high temperature to begin.


E.g.
 In the 1950s and '60s, anxious American families built thousands of underground "fallout shelters" to protect themselves from the radiation of a thermonuclear blast .


Nuclear is the adjective for nucleus, the main central part of an at om. The original nuclear explosives, det onated in 1945, were so-called fission bombs, since they relied on the fission, or split ting, of the nuclei of uranium at oms. Butan even greater source of destructive power lay in nuclear fusion, the forcing t ogether of at omic nuclei. The lightand heat given off by stars such as the sun come from a sustained fusion-or thermonuclear-reaction deep within it . On earth, such thermonuclear reactions were used to develop the hydrogen bomb, a bomb based on a fusion reaction that merged hydrogen at oms to become helium at oms. The thermonuclear era, which began in 1952, produced bombs hundreds of times more powerful than those exploded at the end of World War I. Why the thermo- in thermonuclearE.g.
 Because greatheatis required to trigger the fusion process, and the trigger used is actually a fission bomb.
 
British thermal unit The quantity of heatrequired to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheitata specified temperature.


E.g.
 Wood-st ove manufacturers compete with each other in their claims of how many British thermal unit s of heat out put their st oves can produce.


Despite it s name, the British thermal unit , or BTU, may be more widely used in North America than in Britain. Air conditioners, furnaces, and st oves are generally rated by BTUs. (Though "BTUs" is often short for "BTUs per hour"; in air-conditioner ratings, for instance, "BTUs" really means "BTUs of cooling capacity per hour.") Fuels such as natural gas and propane are also compared using BTUs. The BTU firstappeared in 1876 and isn't part of the metric system- the metric unit of energy is the much smaller joule-so itisn't much used by scientist s, butit s practicality keeps it popular for consumer goods and fuels. A bet ter-known heat unitis the calorie; a BTU is equal to about 252 calories. (Since the familiar food calorie is actually a kilocalorie, a BTU equals only abouta quarter of a food calorie.)
 

 
POLY comes from polys, the Greek word for "many." A polytechnic instit ute offers instruction in many technical fields. Polygamy is marriage in which one has many spouses, or at least more than the legal limit of one. And polysyllabic words are words of many syllables-of which there are quite a few in this book.
 
polyp                   (1) A sea invertebrate thathas a mouth opening at one end surrounded by stinging tentacles. (2) A growth projecting from a mucous membrane, as on the colon or vocal cords.


E.g.
 She had had a polyp removed from her throat , and for two weeks afterward she could only whisper.


This term comes from polypous, a Greek word for "oct opus," which meant literally "many- footed." To the untrained eye, the invertebrate known as the polyp may likewise appear to be many-footed, though it never walks anywhere since it s "feet " are tentacles, used for stinging tiny organisms which the polyp then devours. The types of t umor known as polyps got their name because some seem to be at tached to the surface by branching "foot "-like root s, even though most do not . Polyps of the nose or vocal cords are usually only inconvenient , causing breathing difficulty or hoarseness, and can be removed easily; however, polyps in the intestines can sometimes turn cancerous.
 
polyglot                      (1) One who can speak or write several languages. (2) Having or using several languages.


E.g.
 As trade bet ween countries increases, there is more need for polyglot s who can actas negotiat ors.


Polyglot contains the root glot, meaning "language." Itis used both as a noun and as an adjective. Thus, we could say thatan international airportis bound to be polyglot, with people from all over the world speaking their native languages. One of hist ory's more interesting polyglot s was the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, who claimed thathe addressed his horse only in German, conversed with women in Italian and with men in French, butreserved Spanish (his original language) for his talks with God.
 
polymer              A chemical compound formed by a reaction in which two or more molecules combine to form larger molecules with repeating structural unit s.


E.g.
 Nylon, a polymer commercially introduced in 1938, can be spun and woven into fabrics or castas t ough, elastic blocks.


There are many natural polymers,  including shellac, cellulose,  and rubber. But synthetic polymers only came into being around 1870 with Celluloid, known especially for it s use in phot ographic film. After many decades of development , the polymeric compounds now include polypropylene, used in milk crates, luggage, and hinges; polyurethane, used in paint s, adhesives, molded items, rubbers, and foams; and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), used to make pipes that won'trust . And let 's not forget polyester, which gave us a lot of uncool clothing in the 1970s but whose strength  and  resistance to corrosion  have  ensured  that  it  remains  an extremely useful material for all kinds of goods.
 
polygraph                      An instrument  for recording changes in several bodily functions (such as blood pressure and rate of breathing) at the same time; lie detect or.


E.g.
 My brother-in-law is completely law-abiding, buthe's such a nervous type thathe's failed two polygraph test s at job interviews.


With it s graph- root (see GRAPH) , polygraph  indicates thatit writes out several differentresult s. A polygraph's out put consist s of a set of squiggly lines on a computer screen, each indicating one function being tested. The functions most commonly measured are blood pressure, breathing rate, pulse, and perspiration, all of which tend to increase when you lie. Polygraphs have been in use since 1924, and have got ten more sensitive over the years, though many expert s still believe that they're unreliable and thata prepared liar can fool the machine. They're used not only for law enforcement but perhaps more often by employers- often the police depart mentit self!-who don't want to hire someone who has broken the law in the past but won'tadmit to it .
 
PRIM comes from primus, the Latin word for "first ." Something primary is firstin time, rank, or importance. Something primitive is in it s first stage of development . And something primeval had it s origin in the first period of world or human hist ory.
 
primal                    Basic or primitive.


E.g.
 There was always a primal pleasure in listening to the rain beat on the roof at nightand dropping off to sleep in front of the fire.


Primal generally describes something powerful and almostinstinctual. So when we speak of the primal innocence of youth or the primal intensity of someone's devotion, we're suggesting that the emotions or conditions being described are basic to our animal nature. Sit ting around a campfire may feel like a primal experience, in which we share the emotions of our cave- dwelling ancest ors. Intense fear of snakes or spiders may have primal root s, owing to the poison that some species carry. In "primal scream" therapy, popular in the 1970s, patient s relive painful childhood experiences and express their frustration and anger through uncontrolled screaming and even violence.
 
primer                    (1) A small book for teaching children to read. (2) A small introduct ory book on a subject .


E.g.
 She announced that she'd be passing outa primer on mutual funds at the end of the talk.


Primers were once a standard part of every child's education. The first primer printed in North America, The New England Primer (ca. 1690), was typical; it contained many quotations from the Bible and many moral lessons, and the text was accompanied by numerous woodcutillustrations. We no longer use the word in early education, butit 's widely used in everyday speech. Notice how primer is pronounced; don't mix it up with the kind of paint that 's pronounced with a long i sound.
 
primate                   Any member of the group of animals thatincludes human beings, apes, and monkeys.


E.g.
 Dr. Leakey sent three young women to work with individual primates: Jane Goodall with the chimpanzees, Dian Fossey with the gorillas, and Birute Galdakis with the orangutans.


It was the great biologist Carolus Linnaeus who gave the primates their name, to indicate thatanimals of this order were the mostadvanced of all. Linnaeus listed human beings with the apes a hundred years before Charles Darwin would publish his famous work on evolution. When people t old him that our close relationship to the apes and monkeys was impossible because it disagreed with the Bible, he responded that , from the biological evidence, he simply couldn't come to a different conclusion. Among the mammals, the primates are distinguished by their large brains, weak sense of smell, lack of claws, long pregnancies, and long childhoods, among other  things. Along  with  the  apes  and  monkey, the  Primate  order  includes  such interesting animals as the lemurs, tarsiers, galagos, and lorises.
 
primordial                   (1) First created or developed. (2) Existing in or from the very beginning.


E.g.
 Many astronomers think the universe is continuing to evolve from a primordial cloud of gas.


Primordial can be traced back to the Latin word primordium,  or  "origin,"  and  applies to something thatis only the starting pointin a course of development or progression. A primordial landscape is one that bears no sign of human use, and a primordial cell is the first formed and least specialized in a line of cells. The substance out of which the earth was formed and from which all life evolved is commonly called "the primordial ooze" or "the primordial soup"-even by scientist s.
 

 
HOM/HOMO comes from homos, the Greek word for "same," which in English words may also mean "similar." A homograph is a word spelled like another word but differentin meaning or pronunciation, and a homosexual is a person who favors others of the same sex. (This roothas nothing to do with the Latin homo, meaning "person," as in Homo sapiens, the French homme, and the Spanish hombre.)
 
homonym                    One of two or more words pronounced and/or spelled alike but differentin meaning.


E.g.
 The pool of "a pool of water" and the pool of "a game of pool" are homonyms.


Homonym can be troublesome because it may refer to three distinct classes of words. Homonyms may be words with identical pronunciations but different spellings and meanings, such as to, too, and two. Or they may be words with both identical pronunciations and identical spellings but different meanings, such as quail (the bird) and quail (to cringe). Finally, they may be words thatare spelled alike butare differentin pronunciation and meaning, such as the bow of a ship and bow that shoot s arrows. The firstand second types are sometimes called homophones, and the second and third types are sometimes called homographs-which makes naming the second type a bit confusing. Some language scholars prefer to limithomonym to the third type.
 
homogeneous
      (1)  Of  the  same  or  a  similar  kind. (2)  Of  uniform structure or composition throughout .


E.g.
 Though she was raised in a small t own, she found the city more interesting because it s population was less homogeneous.


A slab of rock is homogeneous if it consist s of the same material throughout , like granite or marble. A neighborhood might be called homogeneous if all the people in itare similar, having pret ty much the  same background, education, and  out look. Homogeneity is fine in a rock, though some people find ita lit t le boring in a neighborhood (while others find it comforting). Note that many people spell this word homogenous, and pronounce it that way t oo.
 
homologous                           Developing from the same or a similar part  of a remote ancest or.


E.g.
 Arms and wings are homologous structures thatreveal the ancientrelationship bet ween birds and four-legged animals.


In his famous discussion of the panda's thumb, Stephen Jay Gould carefully explains how this thumb is nothomologous to the human thumb. Although the two digit s are used in much the same way (the panda's thumb is essential for stripping bamboo of it s tasty leaves, the staple of the panda's diet ), the panda's thumb developed from a bone in it s wristand is an addition to the five "fingers" of it s paw. The tiny stirrup and anvil bones of our inner ear, however, do seem to be homologous with the bones thatallow a garter snake to swallow a frog whole.
 
homogenize
    (1) To  treat  (milk) so  that  the  fat  is  mixed  throughoutinstead of floating on t op. (2) To change (something) so thatit s part s are the same or similar.


E.g.
 By now the suburb had got ten so homogenized thathe couldn't tell the families on his streetapart .


Homogenized milk has been around so long-abouta hundred years-that many Americans have never seen milk with the cream on t op, and probably think cream separation  only happens in expensive yogurt . Buthomogenize was being used before anyone succeeded in get ting milk and cream to mix. People who use the word often dislike the idea thateverything is becoming the same, whether it 's radio shows thatare no longer produced locally or schools thatrely t oo much on standardized testing.
 
DIS comes from Latin, where it means "apart ." In English, it s meanings have increased to include "opposite" or "not " (as in distaste, disagreeable), "deprive of" (disinfect), or "exclude or expel from" (disbar). The original meaning can still be seen in a word like dissipate, which means "to break up and scat ter."
 
dissuade                       To convince (someone) not to do something.


E.g.
 The thought of the danger he might be facing on the journey makes her uneasy, and she's trying to dissuade him from going.


Dissuade is the opposite of persuade, though it 's a less common word. The dissuading may be done by a person or by something else: A bad weather forecast may dissuade a fisherman from going out to sea that day, buta warning on a cigaret te pack almost never dissuades a real smoker from having his or her next cigaret te.
 
disorient
    To cause to be confused or lost .


E.g.
 By now the hikers were completely disoriented, and darkness was falling fast .


The Orient  is the East  (just  as the Occident  is the West ). The verb orient comes from the traditional practice of building Christian churches so that the altar is at the building's easterly end-in other words, "orienting" the church. One reason for this practice is that the Book of Mat thew says, "As the light ning comes from the East . . . so also will the Son of Man"-thatis, just like the sun in the morning, Jesus in his Second Coming will appear in the East . Orienteering is participating in a cross-country race in which each person uses a map and compass to navigate the course. Orient comes from the word meaning "to rise" (like the sun), and still t oday it 's easy for a hiker to become disoriented when an overcast sky hides the sun.
 
discredit
  (1) To cause (someone or something) to seem dishonest or untrue.
(2) To damage the reputation of (someone).


E.g.
 His book had been thoroughly discredited by scholars,  and his reputation was badly damaged.


Since one meaning of creditis "trust ," discredit means basically  "destroy  one's  trust ."  A scientific st udy may be discredited if it turns outit was secret ly writ ten up by someone paid by a drug company. An aut obiography may be discredited if someone discovers that the best part s came out of a novel. A lawyer may try to discredit testimony in a trial by revealing that  the wit ness just got out of the slammer. Many political campaigns rely on discrediting one's opponent s; desperate politicians have learned that , if they can claim that someone at tacking them has been completely discredited, it might work even if itisn't true.
 
dislodge                  To force out of a place, especially a place of rest , hiding, or defense.


E.g.
 Senat ors are at tempting to dislodge the bill from the commit tee, where the chairman has failed to act on it for five months.


A lodge is usually a kind of roominghouse or hotel, and the verb lodge often means staying or sleeping in such a place. Thus, dislodge means removing a person or thing from where it 's been staying. So, for instance, you might use a t oothpick to dislodge a seed from bet ween your teeth, police might use tear gas to dislodge a sniper from his hiding place, and a slate tile dislodged from a roof could be dangerous to someone hanging out on the street below.
 

 
Latin Borrowings

ad hoc                      Formed or used for a particular purpose or for immediate needs.


E.g.
 The faculty formed an ad hoc commit tee to deal with the question of Firstamendmentright s on campus.


Ad hoc literally means "for this" in Latin, and in English this almostalways means "for this specific purpose." Issues that come up in the course of a project often require immediate, ad hoc solutions. An ad hoc investigating commit tee is authorized to look into a mat ter of limited scope. An ad hoc ruling by an athletic council is intended to set t le a particular case, and is not meant to serve as a model for later rulings. If an organization deals with t oo many things on an ad hoc basis, it may mean someone hasn't been doing enough planning.
 
ad hominem
     Marked by an at tack on an opponent 's character rather than by an answer to the argument s made or the issues raised.


E.g.
 Presidential campaigns have often relied on ad hominem at tacks rather than serious discussion of importantissues.


Ad hominem in Latin means "to the man"-thatis, "against the other person." The term comes from the field of rhet oric (the art of speaking and writing). If you have a weak argument , one easy way to defend yourself has always been to at tack your opponent verbally in a personal way. Since such at tacks require neither truth nor logic to be effective, their popularity has never waned.
 
alter ego                          (1) A trusted friend or personal representative. (2) The opposite side of a personality.


E.g.
 The White House chief of staff is a political alter ego, who knows, or should know, who and what the President considers mostimportant .


In Latin, alter ego literally means "second I." An alter ego can be thought of as a person's clone or second self.

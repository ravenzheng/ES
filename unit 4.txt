Quiz4-1 Quiz4-2 Quiz4-3 Quiz4-4 Quiz4-5 ReviewQuizzes4

VOR comes from the Latin verb vorare, "to eat ," and the ending -ivorous shows up in words thatrefer to eaters of certain kinds of food. Frugivorous (for "fruit -eating"), granivorous (for "grain-eating"), and graminivorous (for "grass-eating") aren't t oo rare, butyou won'trun across phytosuccivorous ("plant -sap-eating") every day.
 
carnivorous
      Meat -eating or flesh-eating.


E.g.
 He'd got ten tired of his vegetarian guinea pigs and decided he preferred carnivorous pet s such as ferret s.


The order of mammals that Linnaeus named the Carnivora includes such families as the dogs, the bears, the raccoons, the weasels, the hyenas, the cat s, and the seals. Most carnivores eat only meatin the wild, but some have varied diet s; some bears, for instance, normally eat far more vegetation than meat . Carnivores have powerful jaws and complex teeth, and mostare highly intelligent . Humans, like their ape cousins, are basically omnivores (see omnivore).
 
herbivorous
      Plant -eating.


E.g.
 In spite of their frightening appearance, marine iguanas are peaceable herbivorous animals that feed most ly on seaweed.


Many herbivorous animals, such as rabbit s, deer, sheep, and cows, are noted for their gent le and passive ways. But such behavior is not universal among herbivores. Rhinoceroses and elephant s, for instance, are capable of inflicting serious damage if threatened, and among dinosaurs, the herbivorous Diplodocus had a thick tail that could be used as a lethal weapon againstat tacking carnivores. Herbivorous humans are usually called vegetarians.
 
insectivorous
 Feeding on insect s.


E.g.
 Their rather odd 12-year-old son keptinsectivorous plant s in his bedroom and fed them live flies.


A wide variety of animals could be called insectivores-most of the birds, for example, as well as the spiders. Of the amphibians, frogs and many lizards are largely insectivorous. Even some fish get much of their food from insect s. The order of mammals called Insectivora contains the shrews, moles, and hedgehogs, though bat s and anteaters are also insectivores. Many insect s are themselves insectivores; the dragonfly, for instance, is a swiftinsectivorous terror that lives up to it s name. Butit 's the insectivorous plant s that tend to fascinate us; of the over 600 species, the best known are the Venus flytrap (which snaps shut on it s prey), the pitcher plant s (which drown insect s in a tiny pool of water), and the sundews (which capture insect s with their sticky surfaces).
 
voracious
 Having a huge appetite.


E.g.
 One of the hardest part s of dieting is watching skinny people with voracious appetites consume large amount s of food without gaining weight .


Voracious can be applied to people, animals, and even things, and doesn'talways refer to consuming food. Thus, teenagers are voracious eaters; you may become a voracious reader on vacation; and Americans have long been voracious consumers. The most voracious bat s may eat three-quarters of their weightin insect s in a single night . Some countries have a voracious appetite for oil. Voracious corporations keep "swallowing" other companies through mergers.
 
CARN comes from a Latin word meaning "flesh" or "meat ." Carnation originally meant "the color of flesh," which was once the only color of the flower we call the carnation. In Christian countries, Lentis the period when the faithful traditionally give up something they love, often meat . The days leading up to Lentare known as the carnival season, from the Italian carnelevare, later shortened to carnevale, which meant "removal of meat "-though during carnival, of course, people indulge in justabouteverything, and the removal of  meat only comes later.
 
carnage                   Great destruction of life (as in a bat t le); slaughter.


E.g.
 Countries around the world appealed to all sides of the conflict to st op the carnage of the war in Bosnia.


This word was taken over straight from French (a Latin-based language), and has most ly referred to large-scale killing in wartime. But carnage needn'trefer only to slaughter on the bat t lefield. With tens of thousands of people dying each year in aut omobile accident s, it 's appropriate to speak of carnage on the nation's highways. And those concerned about the effect s of the violence we see constant ly on TV and movie screens may refer to thatas carnage as well.
 
carnal                     Having to do with bodily pleasures.


E.g.
 The news st ories about st udent s on Spring Break tend to focus on the carnal pleasures associated with the annual ritual.


In Christianity in past centuries, carnal was often used as the opposite of spiritual, describing whatare sometimes called "the pleasures of the flesh." Thus, glut t ony-the consumption of excessive food and drink-was a deadly carnal sin, whereas the holiest  monks and hermit s mighteathardly anything and never t ouch wine. Today carnal has a somewhat old-fashioned sound; when we use it , we generally mean simply "sexual."
 
incarnate
Given bodily or actual form; especially, having human body.


E.g.
 For the rest of his life, he would regard his childhood nanny as goodness incarnate.


Incarnate often has a religious ring to it , since for centuries ithas been used in the Christian church, which regards Jesus as the incarnation of God-thatis, as God made human. Surprisingly, neither word appears in Bible translations; instead, the Latin word incarnatus appears in the Christian creeds (basic statement s of belief) and the Catholic Mass. Regardless, incarnate soon began to be used with various nouns: "the devil incarnate," "evil incarnate," et c. Notice thatincarnate is one of the rare adjectives that usually, but notalways, follows it s noun. Incarnate is also a verb, though with a slight ly different pronunciation: "This report simply incarnates the prejudices of it s authors," "For her followers, she incarnates the virt ue of selflessness," et c.
 
reincarnation
(1)  Rebirth  in  new  bodies  or  forms  of  life. (2) Someone who has been born again with a new body after death.


E.g.
 Even as a child he struck everyone as a reincarnation of his grandfather, notin his features butin his manner and personality.


It 's easy to make fun of people who claim to be the reincarnation of Cleopatra or Napoleon, but they don't come from a culture that takes reincarnation seriously. In Hindu belief, a person must pass through a series of reincarnations-some of which may be as insect s or fish- before fully realizing that the bodily pleasures are shallow and that only spiritual life is truly valuable; only then do the reincarnations cease. For Hindus, an "old soul" is a person who seems unusually wise from early in life, and whose wisdom must  have come from passing through many reincarnations.
 

 
CRED comes from credere, the Latin verb meaning "to believe" or "to entrust ." We have a good creditrating when instit utions trustin our ability to repay a loan, and we carry credentials so that others will believe that we are who we say we are.
 
credence                         Mental acceptance of something as true or real; belief.


E.g.
 He scoffed and said no one still gives any credence to the st ory of the Loch Ness monster.


Credence is close in meaning to belief, but there are differences. Unlike belief, credence is seldom used in connection with faith in a religion or philosophy. Instead credence is often used in reference to report s, rumors, and opinions. And, unlike belief, it tends to be used with the words give, lack, lend,and gain. So a new piece of evidence may lend credence to the alibi of a criminal suspect . Claims thata political candidate can become the next President gain credence only after the candidate wins a few primaries. And although st ories about Elvis sightings persist , they lack credence for most people.
 
credible                    (1) Able to be believed; reasonable to trust  or believe. (2) Good enough to be effective.


E.g.
 Because of her past criminal record, the defense lawyers knew she wouldn't be a credible wit ness.


Credible evidence is evidence that 's likely to be believed. A credible plan is one that mightactually work, and a credible excuse is one your parent s mightactually believe. And justas credible means "believable," the noun credibility means "believability." (But we no longer use incredible to mean the literal opposite of credible, justas we no longer use unbelievable as the literal opposite of believable.) Since cred is short for credibility, "street cred" is the kind of credibility among t ough young people thatyou can only get by proving yourself on the mean street s of the inner city.
 
credulity
 Readiness and willingness to believe on the basis of lit t le evidence.


E.g.
 Thrillers and action movies only succeed if they don't strain our credulity t oo much.


A particularly far-fetched st ory may be said to strain credulity, stretch credulity, put demands on our credulity, or make claims on our credulity. Credulity is a quality of innocentchildren (of all ages) and isn'talways a bad thing; it musthave been pure credulity thatenabled Chicago White Sox and Philadelphia Phillies fans to wait so long for a World Series vict ory ("This is the year they're going to take it !"), which probably made life bearable  for them. The  related adjective is credulous. F. Scot t Fit zgerald once defined advertising as "making dubious promises to a credulous public."
 
credo         (1) A statement of the basic beliefs of a religious faith. (2) A set of guiding principles or beliefs.


E.g.
 She claims she made her money on Wall Street just by following the old credo "Buy low, sell high."


Credo comes straight from the Latin word meaning "I believe," and is the first word of many religious credos, or creeds, such as the Apost les' Creed and the Nicene Creed. But the word can be applied to any guiding principle or set of principles. Of course, you may choose a different credo when you're 52 than when you're 19. Buthere is the credo of the writer H. L. Mencken, writ ten after he had lived quite a few years: "I believe thatitis bet ter to tell the truth than to lie. I believe thatitis bet ter to be free than to be a slave. And I believe thatitis bet ter to know than to be ignorant ."
 
FID comes from fides, the Latin  word  for  "faith"  or  "trust ." Fidelity  is  another  word  for "faithfulness." Confidence is having faith in someone or something. An infidel is someone who lacks a particular kind of religious faith. And the once-popular dog's name Fido is Latin for "I trust ."
 
affidavit
   A sworn statement made in writing.


E.g.
 The whole family had signed affidavit s stating that they believed the will to be valid.


In Latin, affidavit means "he (she) has sworn an oath," and an affidavitis always a sworn writ ten document . If it contains a lie, the person making it may be prosecuted. Affidavit s are often used in court when itisn't possible for someone to appear in person. Police officers must usually file an affidavit with a judge to geta search warrant . Affidavit s (unlike similar signed statement s called depositions) are usually made withoutan opposing lawyer being presentand able to ask questions.
 
diffident                           Lacking confidence; timid, cautious.


E.g.
 He always found ita struggle to gethis most diffident st udent s to speak in front of the class.


Diffident means lacking faith in oneself-in other words, the opposite of confident. Distrustin your abilities or opinions usually makes you hesitate to speak or act . Patient s who feel diffidentaround their doct ors, for example, don't dare ask them many questions. A helpful friend tries to instill confidence in place of diffidence.
 
fiduciary
   (1) Having to do with a confidence or trust . (2) Held in trust for another.


E.g.
 Pension-fund managers have a fiduciary responsibility to invest the pension's funds for the sole benefit of those who will receive the pensions.


A fiduciary relationship is one in which one person places faith in another. St ockbrokers and real-estate agent s have fiduciary duties to their client s, which means they mustactin their client s' best financial interest s. Members of a company's board of direct ors have a fiduciary responsibility to protect the financial interest s of the company's shareholders. There are legal requirement s for those with fiduciary responsibility, and they can be sued for breach  of fiduciary duty if they fail.
 
perfidy                          Faithlessness, disloyalty, or treachery.


E.g.
 While working for the CIA he was lured into becoming a double agent , and it seems he paid a high price for his perfidy.


The perfidious Benedictarnold plot ted with the British to surrender West Point to them during the American Revolution-an act that made his name a synonym for traitor. In recentyears, the perfidy of the double agent s Aldrich Ames (of the CIA) and Roberthanssen (of the FBI) has become not orious.
 

 
CURR/CURS comes from currere, the Latin verb meaning "to run." Although words based on this root don't tend to suggest speed, the sense of movementremains. Current, for instance, refers to running  water in a  stream or river, or electrons running  through a  wire, and an excursion is a trip from one place to another.
 
concurrent
   Happening or operating at the same time.


E.g.
 The killer was sentenced to serve three concurrent life terms in prison.


Things thatare concurrent usually not only happen at the same time butalso are similar to each  other. So, for example, multitasking  computers are  capable  of  performing  concurrent tasks. When we take more than one medication ata time, we run the risks involved with concurrent drug use. And atany multiplex theater several movies are running concurrently.
 
cursory                          Hastily and often carelessly done.


E.g.
 Having spent the weekend going to parties, she had only given the chapter a cursory reading before class on Monday.


Unlike the other words in this section, cursory always implies speed. Butitalso stresses a lack of at tention to detail. Cursory observations are generally shallow or superficial because of their speed. And when citizens complain abouta cursory police investigation of a crime, they're distressed by it s lack of thoroughness, notit s speed.
 
discursive
Passing from one t opic to another.


E.g.
 Some days he allowed himself to write long discursive essays in his diary instead of his usual simple reporting of the day's event s.


The Latin verb discurrere meant "to run about ," and from this word we get our word discursive, which often means rambling about over a wide range of  t opics. A discursive writing style generally isn'tencouraged by writing teachers. But some of the great 19th-century writers, such as Charles Lamb and Thomas de Quincey, show that the discursive essay, especially when gracefully writ ten and somewhat personal in t one, can be a pleasure to read. And the man often called the invent or of the essay, the great Michel de Montaigne, might t ouch on dozens of different t opics in the course of a long discursive essay.
 
precursor
    One that goes before and indicates the coming of another.


E.g.
 Scientist s are trying to identify special geological activity that may be a precursor to an earthquake, which will help them predict the quake's size, time, and location.


With it s prefix pre-, meaning "before," a precursor is literally a "forerunner," and in fact forerunner firstappeared as the translation of the Latin praecursor. But the two words function a lit t le different ly t oday. A forerunner may simply come before another thing, buta precursor generally paves the way for something. So, for example, the Office of Strategic Services in World War I was the immediate precursor of t oday's Central Intelligence Agency, while the blues music of the 1930s and 1940s was only one of the precursors of the rock and roll of t oday.
 
PED comes from the Latin word for "foot ." A pedal is pushed by the foot ; a pedicure is a treat ment of the feet , t oes, and t oenails; and a pedestal is whata stat ue stands on-in a sense, it s foot .
 
quadruped
      An animal having four feet .


E.g.
 She always tells her friends that their farm has five kinds of quadrupeds: sheep, goat s, cows, horses, and pigs.


The quadrupeds include almostall the mammals. (Among the exceptions are whales, bat s, and humans.) The Greek equivalent of this  Latin  word  is tetrapod. However, the  two are  notidentical, since the tetrapod classification includes bipeds such as birds, in which two of the limbs are no longer used for walking. Insect s all have six legs, of course, and in the sea there are eight -legged octopods (including the oct opus). But there are no animals of any kind with an odd number of legs.
 
pedigree
The line of ancest ors of a person or animal.


E.g.
 She talks a lotabouther pedigree, but never mentions thata couple of her uncles spent time in prison.


What does someone's ancestry have to do with feet E.g.
 Because someone once thought thata family tree, or genealogical chart , resembled a crane's foot  (in French, pied de grue), even though cranes' feet only have four talons or claws, no more than any other bird, while a family tree may have hundreds of branches. The word pedigree is usually used for purebred animals
-cat s, racehorses, and dogs, as well as livest ock such as cows and sheep. Some people continue to believe that "purity" in human family trees is a good thing as well, though most of us find the idea a lit t le creepy.
 
impediment
    Something thatinterferes with movement or progress.


E.g.
 Her poorly developed verbal ability was the most serious impediment to her advancement .


Impediment comes from a Latin verb that meant "to interfere with" or "to getin the way of progress," as if by tripping up the feet of someone walking. In English, impediment still suggest s an obstruction or obstacle along a path; for example, a lack of adequate roads and bridges would be called an impediment to economic development . Impediment s usually getin the way of something we want . So we may speak of an impediment to communication, marriage, or progress-but something that slows the progress of aging, disease, or decay is rarely called an impediment .
 
pedestrian
 Commonplace, ordinary, or unimaginative.


E.g.
 While politicians endlessly discussed the greatissues facing Russia, the Russians worried about such pedestrian concerns as finding enough food, shelter, and clothing.


Most of us know pedestrian as a noun meaning someone  who  travels  on  foot . But  the adjective sense of pedestrian as defined here is actually it s original meaning. To be pedestrian was to be drab or dull, as if plodding along on footrather than speeding on horseback or by coach. Pedestrian is often used to describe a colorless or lifeless writing style, butit can also describe politicians, public tastes, personal qualities, or possessions. In comparison with the elaborate stage shows put on by t oday's rock artist s, for instance, most of  the  stage presentations of 1960s rock stars seem pedestrian.
 

 
FLECT comes from flectere, the Latin verb meaning "to bend." The root sometimes takes the form flex-. Things thatare flexible can be bent , and when you flex a muscle, you're usually bending a limb-which, as a trainer at the gym will tell you, requires the use of flexor muscles.
 
deflect                     To turn aside, especially from a straight or fixed course.


E.g.
 The stealth technology used on bombers and fighter jet s works by deflecting radar energy, making them "invisible."


Use of the physical meaning of deflectis common. Thus, a soccer goalie's save mightinvolve deflecting the ball rather than catching it , and workers wear eye shields to deflect tiny particles flying out of machines. But the nonphysical meaning may be even more common. A Hollywood actress might deflect criticism abouther personal life by giving lavishly to charity, for example, and we've all tried to change the subject to deflecta question we really didn't want to answer.
 
reflective                   (1) Capable of reflecting light , images, or sound waves. (2) Thought ful.


E.g.
 He likes action movies and going out drinking with friends, but when you get to know him you realize he's basically reflective and serious.


Reflective people are people who reflect on things-thatis, look back at things thathave been done or said in order to think calmly and quiet ly about them. Mostreflective people would agree with Socrates that (as he t old the jury that would soon sentence him to death) "The unexamined life is  not  worth  living."  Reflective  people  tend to be  a  bit  philosophical and intellectual. Butalmosteveryone has reflective moods; gazing into a fireplace or a campfire seems to do it to almosteveryone.
 
genuflect
   To kneel on one knee and then rise as an act of respect .


E.g.
 Atreligious shrines in China, pilgrims may not only genuflect butactually lie down flat on the ground.


Genuflection, which contains the root genu-, "knee," has long been a mark of respectand obedience. King Arthur's Knight s of the Round Table genuflected not only when he knighted  them but whenever they greeted him formally, and this cust om remains in countries t oday thatare still ruled by royalty. In some churches, each worshipper is expected to genuflect whenever entering or leaving a pew on the central aisle.
 
inflection                      (1) A change in the pitch, t one, or loudness of the voice. (2) The change in form of a word showing it s case, gender, number, person, tense, mood, voice, or comparison.


E.g.
 She couldn't understand her grandfather's words, but she knew from his inflection thathe was asking a question.


Changing the pitch, t one, or loudness of our words are ways we communicate meaning in speech, though not on the printed page. A rising inflection at the end of a sentence generally indicates a question, and a falling inflection indicates a statement , for example. Another way of inflecting words is by adding endings: -s to make a noun plural, -ed to puta verb in the past tense, -er to form the comparative form of an adjective, and so on.
 
POST comes from a Latin word meaning "after" or "behind." A postscript (or PS) is a note that comes after an otherwise completed let ter, usually as an afterthought . Postpartum refers to the period following childbirth, with any related event s and complications. To postdate a check is to give ita date after the day it was writ ten.
 
posterior
  Situated t oward or on the back; rear.


E.g.
 In a human posterior and dorsal can both refer to the back, butin a fish posterior refers to the tail area.


Posterior comes from the Latin word posterus, meaning "coming after." Posterior is often used as a technical term in biology and medicine to refer to the back side of things, and is the opposite of anterior, which refers to the front side. For example, as more people t ook up running as a sport , doct ors began to see an increase in stress fractures along the posterior as well as the anterior surface of the lower leg bones. In some technical fields, posterior may mean "later." When used as a noun, posterior simply means "but t ocks."
 
posthumous                    (1) Published after the death of the author. (2) Following or happening after one's death.


E.g.
 Though Van Gogh scarcely sold a single painting during his lifetime, he rose to posthumous fame as one of the world's greatartist s.


Posthumous fame is fame that comes a lit t le late. In fact , it s original meaning in English is "born after the death of the father." Bill Clint on was the posthumous son of a father who died in an aut omobile accident . The word is now most ly used of artistic works thatappear after the death of the artist , or the changing reputation of a dead artist . Such posthumous works as Herman Melville's Billy Budd, the diary of Anne Frank, and almostall the poetry of Emily Dickinson have become legendary, and in each case they had a major influence on the writer's reputation.
 
post modern
  Having to do  with  a  movement  in  architecture, art , or literature thatis a reaction against modernism and thatreintroduces traditional element s and techniques in odd context s as well as element s from popular culture.


E.g.
 The post modern AT& T building in New York, with the "Chippendale" t op thatreminds viewers of an antique dresser, aroused a st orm of criticism.


With it s prefix post -, postmodern describes a movement thathas reacted against modernism. Modernism, dating from around the start of the 20th century, represented a sharp break from 19th-century styles. Butin the 1970s architect s began to be dissatisfied with  the  stark simplicity of most modern architecture and began including in their most ly modern designs such traditional element s as columns, arches, and keyst ones and sometimes start ling color contrast s such as mighthave come from advertising and pop culture. In artand literature, as in architecture, postmodernism often seems to be making fun of tradition, especially by denying that there's any real distinction bet ween serious and popular art or writing. Wherever ithas shown up, post modernism has been  greeted with  a mixture of approval, disapproval, and sometimes amusement .
 
post mortem
  (1) Occurring after death. (2) Following the event .


E.g.
 In their post mortem discussion of the election, the reporters tried to explain how the polls and predictions could have been so completely wrong.


Post mortem is Latin for "after death." In  English, postmortem  refers to an  examination, investigation, or process that takes place after death. A post mortem examination of a body (often simply called a postmortem) is often needed to determine the time and cause of death; the stiffening called rigor mortis is one post mortem change that doct ors look at to determine when death occurred. Today we've come to use postmortem to refer to any examination or discussion that takes place after an event .
 

 
Words from Mythology

calypso                     A folk song or style of singing of West Indian origin thathas a lively rhythm and words thatare often made up by the singer.


E.g.
 If you take a Caribbean vacation in December, you end up listening to a lot of Christ mas carols played to a calypso beat .


In Homer's Odyssey, the nymph Calypso detains Odysseus for seven years on his way home from the Trojan War, using all her wiles to hold him on her lush island. For many people, the calypso music of the West Indian islands, which was eventually brought to America by singers such as the Andrews Sisters and later Harry Belafonte, has some of the same captivating power as the nymph, though the lyrics thatare often improvised to the melodies tend to make fun of local people and happenings. The original name for these songs, however, actually seems to be based on a similar-sounding African word, for which, early in the 20th century, someone began substit uting this name from Greek mythology.
 
odyssey             (1) A long, wandering journey full of trials and adventures. (2) A spiritual journey or quest .


E.g.
 Their six-month camping trip around the country was an odyssey they would always remember.


Odysseus, the hero of Homer's Odyssey, spends 20 years traveling home from the Trojan War. He has ast onishing adventures and learns a great deal abouthimself and the world; he even descends to the underworld to talk to the dead. Thus, an odyssey is any long, complicated journey, often a quest for a goal, and may be a spiritual or psychological journey as well as an actual voyage.
 
palladium                          A precious, silver-white metal related to platinum thatis used in electrical contact s and as an alloy with gold to form white gold.


E.g.
 Most wedding rings t oday are simple bands of gold, platinum, or palladium.


Pallas Athena was one of the poetical names given to the Greek goddess Athena (although it 's no longer clear what Pallas was supposed to mean), and the original palladium was a stat ue of Athena that was believed to have the power to protect the ancient city of Troy. When an asteroid belt was discovered bet ween Mars and Jupiter, most of the asteroids were named after figures in Greek mythology, and one of the first to be discovered was named Pallas in 1803. In the same year, scientist s isolated a new silvery metal element , which they named palladium in honor of the recent ly discovered asteroid.
 
Penelope
   A modest domestic wife.


E.g.
 Critics of Hillary Rodham Clint on in the 1990s would perhaps have preferred her to be a Penelope, quiet ly tending the White House and staying out of politics.


In the Odyssey, Penelope wait s 20 long years for her husband Odysseus to return from Troy. During that time, she mustraise their son and fend off the at tentions of numerous rough suit ors. She preserves herself for a long time by saying she cannotremarry until she has finished weaving a funeral shroud for her aging father-in-law; however, what she weaves each day she secret ly unravels each night . A Penelope thus appears to be the perfect , patient , faithful wife (and may be using her clever intelligence to keep herself that way).
 
procrustean                           Ruthlessly disregarding individual differences or special circumstances.


E.g.
 The school's procrustean approach seemed to assume thatall children learned in the same way and at the same rate.


In the Greek tale of the hero Theseus, Procrustes was a bandit who ambushed travelers and, after robbing them, made them lie on an iron bed. To make sure they "fit " this bed, he would cut off the part s thathung off the ends or stretch the body if it was t oo short ; either way, the unlucky traveler always died. When he made the mistake of confronting Theseus, Procrustes was made to "fit " his own bed. Something procrustean takes no account of individual differences but cruelly and mercilessly makes everything the same.
 
protean                (1) Displaying great  versatility or variety. (2) Able to take on many different forms or natures.


E.g.
 A protean athlete, he left college with offers from the professional leagues to play baseball, foot ball, and basket ball.


As the st ory is t old in the Odyssey, at the end of the Trojan War the sea god Proteus revealed to King Menelaus of Sparta how to gethome from Troy with his unfaithful wife, the beautiful Helen of Troy. Before Proteus would give up the information, though, Menelaus had to capture him-no mean feat , since Proteus had the ability to change into any natural shape he chose. The word protean came to describe this ability to change into many different shapes or to play many differentroles in quick succession.
 
sibyl                 A female prophet or fort une-teller.


E.g.
 The villagers t old him aboutan aged woman who lived alone in a hut on a nearby mountain, a sibyl who knew the future and would prophesy under the right conditions.


Ancient writers refer to the existence of various women in such countries as  Babylonia, Greece, Italy, and Egypt , through whom the gods regularly spoke. These sibyls were easy to confuse with the oracles, women who were likewise mouthpieces of the gods, at such sites as Apollo's temple at Delphi. The most famous sibyl was the Sibyl of Cumae in Italy, a withered crone who lived in a cave. Her prophecies were collected into t welve books, three of which survived to be consulted by the Romans in times of national emergencies. She is one of the five sibyls memorably depicted by Michelangelo on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
 
siren                  A woman who tempt s men with bewitching sweet ness.


E.g.
 Reporters treated her like a sex symbol, but she lacked the graceful presence and air of mystery of a real siren.
